the thoughts of wildlife photographer johan siggessonnajin   kenya a few days ago i posted a picture of me photographing fatu i got many questions privately about this post and i decided to post a more complete post on the subjectfatu is one of only two remaining northern white rhinos left on this planet both females yesterday i read something somewhere that stuck in my mind this is not an extinction that is based on evolution but is due to humans killing these creatures to cut off their hornssuck on that one for a while this is not fatu this is najin   fatus mother due to human greed they are the very last two remaining individuals of their subspecies on this planet poachers fueled by the myth of rhino horns holding magical powers have slaughtered the others of their kind for decadesin  najin fatu sudan and suni were living in a zoo in czech republic they refused to breed and they were eventually moved to the grasslands of ol pejeta conservancy in kenya with the hope that they will successfully breed it didnt happen and over the years sudan suni and a few others held in zoos around the world died and only females were left fatu and najinnajin and fatu are now roaming in a acre enclosure with a  7 armed guards safeguarding their existence as the last ambassadors of their kind so is all hope lost no it is not there is still a fragile hope a glimmer in the eyes of the scientists fatus eggs fertilized with preserved sperm from deceased males held the potential for new life the fate of the northern white rhino relies on a scientific gamble   in vitro fertilization and stem cell technology these techniques uncharted territory for rhinos are expensive and complexthe procedure is under way and if it turns out a successful one we might once again see northern white rhinos roam the plains of africa once more fingers crossed now but did we have to let it go this far really kill them all and then try to revive them a really messed up story with a few unsung heroes working tirelessly hours a day atplease share this story

fallacies are all your coming up w  there are many types of fallacies that people who exploit animals repetitively use u like using the all or nothing fallacy if you resort to fallacies then youre going to repetitively be called out for them fallacies arent logic

when people who exploit animals mistake empathic awareness for fear emotional intelligence just isnt their strong suit theyre still using irrelevant scenarios & outlandish excuses trying to justify its ok to exploit & inhumanely slaughter other sentient living individuals
thats because majority of humans r a selfish entitled species that ignores the horrific suffering of other sentient individuals for minute sensory pleasures wasting time validating that its ok to exploit & slaughter billions of animals annually not something to brag about
insults are used by those who do not aquire any logic behind their reasoning it is usually the only contribution someone who exploit animals is able to give
in some form or another the vast majority relies on supply and demand in some form ironic how majority of people who eat animals state they live sustainably the statistics of the billions of animals exploited and slaughtered annually begs to differ

yes if the definition of poached changes from year to year it makes it hard to compare things hopefully south africa is being consistent with its definitions we can only analyze what is available if what is available is incorrect everyones understanding suffers
in  the ratio between poaching and headcount was likely 18533 in  the ratio between poaching and headcount was likely 17221 all things being equal it should have been 17221 so poaching has dropped faster than the total population thats a good thing
our estimates are for all of south africa and implicitly account for private reserves since we extrapolate from beleaguered state owned reserves we may have actually underestimated the total population size which means an even bigger decrease in poaching might have occurred
perhaps however our analysis shows that even if there are fewer to poach there is likely still a real decrease in poaching check it out
