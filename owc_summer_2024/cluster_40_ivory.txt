anger is useful if it is being channeled into a valuable direction if someone only harbours anger they live in resentmentresentment ensures living in the past
there is a growing market for mens coaching starring women im glad you brought this to attention & her actions to account may those men also wisen up to invest their money energy in a truly life giving way the desire to give is beautiful when not done for approval
imagine yourself getting things done & building things from the energy of joy and purpose vs self hategoing to the gym because you value being strong & disciplined vs i tear myself up in the gym because i hate myself
many people in the helping professions are there out of an unconscious desire to heal their own unresolved issues through others it is important to do ones own work as they are intending to support others otherwise we unintentionally get ourselves & others in trouble
thanks for sharing i wanted to ask you about this one because ive come across articles saying that children dont learn anything from time outs at home or at school they just understand that being isolated is a form of punishment for something that they did that isnt approved of do you have other ideas about what you might do as an alternative to time outs
i havent explored much of the nutritional aspect of mental health but have heard others speak to it its certainly a holistic approach that brings about optimal wellbeing
yes and when a man experiences being seen & valued he is that much more inspired to rise to his highest potential
this is a great one for men who tend to respond to their woman what do you mean spend more time together were always togetherits about the quality of the connection shed rather have minutes of you deeply present & connected than minutes of you zoned out & complacent
more people are getting into it precisely because of the dollar signs & images of living a specific lifestyle portrayed by coaching influencersbut the real joy & satisfaction is in the transformation results and over delivering because you want to see clients win
you hit it anger is useful if it is being channeled into a valuable direction if someone only harbours anger they live in resentmentresentment ensures living in the past
not only fatigue & insecurity but it can also lead to helping others from a wounded place eg needing to be needed savior complex etc
there is a growing market for mens coaching starring women im glad you brought this to attention & her actions to account may those men also wisen up to invest their money energy in a truly life giving way the desire to give is beautiful when not done for approval
beautifully said reminds me of denzel washington saying dont confuse movement for progress we can fool ourselves into thinking that our busy work is actually getting things done
simple & powerful this quality will be even more important moving forward in our day & age people everywhere are offering knowledge & things to sell the ones doing it from genuine care & service will be felt
being invited told to do something is a great one i think there are a good number of children who are used to being told to be quiet behave or sit still chores errands done w  parents allows them to feel part of something bigger than themselves
the eagerness to step in to help often has to do with the parents anxiety with seeing their child struggle or not do something the way they would an example can be when a parent interferes with a childs play because no no this is how you should do it

what questions have you asked yourself that have helped you challenge your world view
it often appears to me as if much of technological progress is blind self loathing centered busyworkthey who are unable to be satisfied with little will ultimately be satisfied with nothingand that *is* sad to observe

the more im able to do that just let things be as they are the easier it becomes to stay calm in the face of differencewe are as we are

with the recent discourse on hellblade and the term walking sims and criticism on gameplay a few things a walking sim is a condescending term used way too often and its disingenuous b try to understand the gaming experience you are walking into theres enough coverage for most to do research ahead of time c gaming experiences are personal to each indvidual i personally wont take you seriously if you use the term walking sim on point c i absolutely adore quantic dream games but also understand its not for everyonepeace

frustrations of other boothers when i saw the djm map i genuinely didnt have any expectations bc of how many booths there wasthere were also no signage at all which was confusing as hell i gave up looking for people bc it was so confusing and i can imagine boothers
this is a very good read for people who plan to booth at djm in the future i couldnt even walk in the crowd for long or look for everyone i wanted to look for because it was just too much and too over stimulating i would recommend cons with 200 booths +

omg im defo coming to ddam now i need your goodies
thank you for taking the time to type this thread honestly i got so over stimulated with so many things to see i just gave up walking around and i can imagine boothers losing sales bc of this reason tooi hope djm downsizes next year its nice to be inclusive but

please do me a favor and check what those sources that confirm that he was never mentioned that he was a samurai ill save you some time one is a hollywood movie other is a japanese buzz feed article
why would it be cultural appropriation when yasuke black samurai was an actual historic figure who lived in feudal japan during warring states era and served under oda nobunaga as a samurai 
he was a samurai under oda nobunaga the first and only non japanese person to be a samurai so if they decided to add him not just made up char then kudos to them they actually managed to include a pos character without race swapping

fuck bill barr
a bs artist slinging bs to tickle the racist funny bone how very republican
as a woman he can fuck off
he absolutely is racist with a long and demonstrated history of it even you know hes racist or you wouldnt have rushed right over trying to tell us yet again we didnt see and hear what we just saw and heard*ck
this man is racist to his core ffs he is the old grandpa you pray doesnt embarrass the hell out of you
nobodys being quiet he needs to recuse at the very least
roflmao blocked this moron so stupid
and his first chance to vote huh
ummm i dont hate anyone but he is the closest i have ever come and i have to wrestle with it at that
the shit this man makes up is off the charts ignorant
read project  thats where his drivel comes from
he wouldnt piss in a single one of them if they were on fire how on earth can they believe he gets them when he believes he is fundamentally superior to them any one of them would be ordered to change his diaper or bring him a big mac as a servant never an equalcrazy
hes lying as usual
math really isnt his thing is it ffs this dumbass is just a damn embarrassment

the one whos never satisfied
bwahahahaha im trying to get blocked by him fucker has thick skin
bwahahahaha he just pops up on my feed
i need to find this man and ask where he got it
he looks like he had an bath in s2
is that the one he interviewed for the one show
why is he crying in the first pic
god he looks stunning in that picture
hes got very hypnotic eyes i will say especially with how dark blue they are
  i wonder i wonder he be in the right crowd for it
  fuck only star knows kienzan
i found this really interesting because in other iterations of shang tsung he fights for survival and being powerful this one though he does the same but instead of like using some elaborate scheme to get himself out he accepts his demise
hes so pretty in that
oh exactlyyyy and it just again at the end of day for his sake of survival yet also to exploit others too
it just makes sense too for his situation too
no exactly cause this shang tsung has like no confidence when compared to his counterparts but it makes him so unique and resilient too at the same time
that is true too and i find it even more tragic too cause he seems like hopeful for like the next part and for the next day too
whos the father of the kid
hes got this he can whoop bi hans ass
i jnow who your talking about hes so weird
thats insane though he has a c dot ai
but hes too late
you airstrike him already

from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into theconversation almost all
hecould not resist looking at them once
he should pay folks off properly a thin workingman with frowningbrows and a straggly beard
* he is charming he has no
and doyou know he has fallen in love with sonyawhat
i canread him like a
it would beparticularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me justbecause i have
and what do his father and sister matter to me i lovehim alone him him with that face and
dolokhovsback in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from
having wrung a submissive i understandfrom dron alpatych contented himself with that though
i hope he gets a soul cramp then just a small inconvenient one thoughthank you friend
for the most part i think he achieved his goal but pioneering making bats in underwear serious is an achievement too
the dude sent his bottle hips in a fat suit crowd surfing
weird al was here not too long ago he has no right being so much funhe was sweating his balls off i thought he was going into cardiac arrest lol
this is peak masculinity
well at least we know gege has been batshit insane from birth
this man aint real
why should he care
he made a playbook out of oj simpsons book
hes a h**ler disciple
hes lying about his height
he grooms children
he a fraud
he hates you
he hates you
cuz hes sexy
it makes sense he is the soul kings son so why would he just be able to give the quincies schrifts
john werry doing too much damage man
his reason for fighting is gone and niggas want him to just lock in
i have to admit hes right

chase oliver isnt a name its a description of his recreational activities
listen to the content of his message hes more intelligent than you think he doesnt have all the answers and doesnt pretend to but hes very well versed in the american political conversation with a reach to an audience consisting of younger adults which is very important
durrr he had a gun durrrrr
its not a secret at all that joe is a perv he cant control himself around small children even in his old age imagine how bad he was when he was younger
funny that the thread reader put up a picture of michaelangelos david in a thread about davinci
uncle satlistening slightly smiling with his head on one
its not that i dont remember  i know what he is like but not as iremember
well ive had a bit of fun i can tell you crieddenisov gleeful and yet angry his white teeth
thats not forbidden by his
hes already in his jeep with food  heading her way might be speeding but thats fineee
hes a good boy  swear it 
interested in a late night research session  once all is well  hes cleaned up  got a full belly  his hands idly rest in his lap  unaware of what to do with them aside for play with his fingers 
used to take him a while  mainly get annoyed  but now hes a wrath to be reckoned with when pissed off  
hes a ten  but   
stiles might lowkey want a bite  
he vaguely shrugs theres people who murder while streaming  lay and hide in wait  oh  whats that 
sounds   enticing  you gonna murder me  please dont id fear youd have a whole pack of wolves on you  arms traverse his chest before you go demanding me around  at least take me on a date first 
his damn cheeks are pleasantly flushed at this point flattering me over here   
a guy and his chicken skateboarding duo
dad of the year moves
he overdosed he wasnt killed by the cops cope harder
you know metivier i turned himout of my house this
he knows of course what this loss means to
for instance he iscollecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book tillhe has
i dont trust him
this boy is gorgeous i wanna name him eclipse
cant stress this enough i fucking hate barbz
my dad is a smoker and he struggles to breath
despite the noise of the world he knew you before gossipwalk in skechers with apo
the more arsenal fans see this man the more their migraine worsen we keep telling them hes enzo maresca but they insist hes pep guardiola
enzo maresca feeling himself right now after realizing that chelsea prefer him to others
nah newcastle will tear this man
bad boy mehn
if that guy on yellow die in the future na greed kill am e fit no base on alcohol but other things
hes destined for greatness chelsea will give him life and make him the greatest of all time
he has no say in this man the car will be assembled by the board hes just meant to drive
ive counted more than assists here but were not converted by his colleagues this guy is a generational talent and surpass other players within his age range atm
that mark sacarsm got me fr
i cant say more to what good football experts analysts have said on his appointment he may have done better at leicester and worked with pep while having natural support of the fans why would a manager would choose to be a puppet and go to where he can have no say in transfer
wow amazing how the tyre bounced so perfect simultaneously amazed me more how did he do that
hes a fan amongst millions fans who will still come watch every single game even if the team are not performing well
the more i view his picture the more my excitement well grounded enzo
a glimpse of enzo skill since his arrival at the bridge is just  of his full potential hes too talented and will prove that next season
from his style of play you can easily tell about his love and passion for creativity hes too sightful for great things
yet he looks innocent i love this type of player mourinho will like this guy clean job
he has a good sight
hes still playing good but his energy is diminishing slowly as hes ageing fast it will be better to leave now and follow kross pedigree
respect to modric but i dont rate him high when he refused to give hazard jersey when he got to madrid something he would have done easily if it was messi that asked
just protecting a brother
theres nothing you wont see online during crisis just because hes leading to become our next manager now theres claim that he turned down offer from real madrid when which offer
how about his inability to have a say during transfer did he buy that too
ppl change too hopefully with the suffering he also will
oh ye i think you could ive heard some very technical hurdy gurdy
he should just try and be more independent or at least more perverse ive never seen a drug sequence in a movie that makes it more clear that the guy making it has just never been on enough drugs to do it right
perhaps i have to believe the rumors
i could not agree more brother
he does not have to and he likely never will
i am just reminding you we must respect him even when it is hard to do so
he is my husband
he is our king kings are well endowed
well he too looked like *that
maybe its the level of fame
likes hes the only one i got to this tweet after seeing this a few times and trying to find the source most result were from twitter i didnt find something very helpful about the pic
not sure if he participated or just was a part of the discussionanyway lets be real this is was a problemetic panel some made it clear in advance what they are going to vote like this guy
no he didnt if he was decent he wouldnt interview this racist
we dont know for sure if his daughters even have british passports
i hope he gets the scottish welcome he deserves
his wife is not paying taxes in this country has a green card  and pretends to be an indian citizen while living in london full time so his wealth does matter
only because he got caught on tape
of course it is he just needs to win an election
i feel sorry for his sons it must be embarrassing to have a father like him
he needs to move to texas where his great supporter
i dont trust a word this man says
is this hate allowed on his platform
who is he i dont know
larry its me lesss goooo hahahah
yoooooo my brother pike killing it lfgoooo
hahaha my man biggest thank you for your support
eyooooo looks so cool my man
i have no reason to i dont even attend his church so its not like i want to defend himas at today that i know he lives in lagos and he preaches at his lagos branch every sunday
this isnt true he lives in nigeria
respek in every aspek big boy
tuche ive pretty much said the same thing to him
what the fuck do you know about being relevant jamesyoure just a bit dj on some obscure radio station
so and for balance have a look at his criminal recordnot exactly cleaner than a preachers sheets on a sunday morning now was hesadly this was always going to catch up with him and bite him in the arse
yep dont know who the guy is but hes bang on the money
as leader of the party surely everything has something to do with him
not so bad old boy brandy old chap
who is he
im sorry but what a sad pathetic excuse of a man nigel farage ishes been following whats been going on for long enough to make a detailed decision on if he wants to stand and who for but decided not to bother for whatever reasonthe mans a self centred trick pony
ok who put p in the dickhead
damian priest when it comes to promos as world heavyweight champion
nvm he didnt hit a blue thunder bomb in the entire match
let them fucking kkow come to houston tony fucking khan
yeah he not coming to the federation
kick his dick
isnt bro a heel
was he tryna low blow the ref
tonight he returns
need him to literally break out of the cuffs and spear the first officer in sight
i rip my shirt off every time he hits that flying clothesline
ngl he gotta get off the grill wit this one
tk said the texas crowds are one of the hottest hes been in i take that as a sign i am delusional
his future is bright there expecting two more world title reigns in this contract
max calling himself the wolf of wrestling and saying he wasnt fucking leaving was a reference to jordan belfort in the wolf of wall street
although his best work is as a heel he can work as a babyface but the story he was in turned to absolute shit hopefully its a quick feud wrap up and they both move on
respect maxipad jevonte friedman
im still bummed he wasnt able to go to perth to get his title shot
when i find a man who does this consistently i may have hope again until then its
why are they dog piling on him tho omggg
theres tiktoks floating around of him simping for highschool girls
thank youuuu hes the best
why he look like he playing in his daddys clothes tho
dont know jesus
what the f is wrong with this guy
look at this man so blessed with walk in skechers with apo
guess the name of this footballer
nightmare blunt rotation but its just me and him
his face
i wonder what the k in his name stands foralso k likes and k retweets on the th month at 00
look at his ankles now back to me now back to his ankles
check out his white ankles
am i the only one who doesnt find his videos to be interestinghow long can x last in y when i give him zfeels like the same on repeat
is that this guy from million dollar listing
nah because he is trying to shelter his kids from the real world im saying to raise them so when they are at school they can think for themselves
looks like someone who would have liquor on the mind
im just glad he didnt ask if he could sketch them or do a freestyle rap based off things in their room
lets not forget this kanye gem unfortunately he didnt follow his own advice
i cant believe im hearing of him for the first time here a forgotten martyr for his community
trump found his vp but then he got high
thanks for sharing especially a pain so recent he sounds like a great role model im sure he has passed on that same spirit for life to you which you will in turn pass on to others im named after my grandfather and couldnt be more proud
something like this would be more powerful if he wasnt yelling the whole time the truth is loud enough you dont have to yell over it
that kid with the ms frizzle hair probably cant tell me three books hes read in the past year
kevin kline 
and occasionally wears plunging black bustiers stilettos & killer hats
i get the sentiment butyoure still a filthy devil fruit usera deep rumble came from the prosthetic as he was about to fire a cannon round point blank

thats right and george floyd overdosed as a drugy
i really dont think he went to heaven
george soros look a likeok word 
big boy
my condolences
yup smallville fan here loved seeing him on there dr swann
thats just fanboy nonsense
its narrow minded judgmental he sounds like an old fuddy duddy
he should go back to his hut and stay there tbqhwy
you are quite right that this is way out of my wheelyard and i shall refrain from passing judgement henceforward but my initial response to his tweets was to think has he overstated the importance of the gut biome over the protection afforded to me by facial spf
great readit always seemed that when he was right he was right by accident and when he was wrong he was very wrong i have a particular dislike for him for his continued uncompromising support of lockdowns a thin piece of paper between him and cummings imho
terrible stats arent they i do hope his protestations arent in his zoe emails it could cause a lot of harm skin cancer rates rise by a third but not in sunburn aware youngthetimescouk article b987a
this guy just called me a slur and slept with my college girlfriend
is this deedees son
an actor saying his lines
id bone her but yeah this guys gayish assuming he doesnt bottom lol that old trope
theres very good evidence he himself was a member of the rothchild family his real dad was a bastard his story is cray cray letter from the pope giving him permission to divorce so he could marry his st cousin hitlers mom lol
u dont like harley damian
cant tell if it supposed to say vegetarian or that guy from dragon balll
damian being daddys littke monster is interesting too
excuse me thats me x talia remove that skank from my name
bro looks like the cia got to him
that is a grown ass man and a child
what did thespace loving kid do when he got a toy rocket for his birthdayhe went over the moon
shame  and then to lie over and over that he wasnt involved in hunters business deals  and never met with his partners 
such a good kid always willing to share what he knows even now and he knows an awful lot mostly without patents  so admirable in many ways  however understandable that oftentimes kids dont appreciate or understand the smarties then  when they get older they are the ones standing in line for books and autographs 
this young man is a real hero  even remembering  with a voice of authority to tell someone to call now 
there should be a stiffer punishment for him
his dog
some of his best work
how good that i blocked that fa99ot before he blocked me
am concerned how much bullshit this dude have in his pfp
for no specific reason his most famous documentary was a scam lmao

yeah someone had too just eats me up how he continues to act as is hardcore fans should just accept things that either make no sense or are contradictory to what we want & yet he has the game on all consoles makes content almost daily & makes a living off of destiny
he has the potential
honestly its just upsetting that he brown noses bungie so hardunlike is always fair and balanced gives the most logical arguments & praises when he needs to & condemns when he needs to without prostrating to bungie
goddamn man im trying to hit on this person who the fuck are all yall
shouldnt he have tried to beat him
nice definition but he should grow a beard
it depends on how much older he isif hes + shes definitely in it for the moneylets not lie

boothill comes out tomorrow its the th in my timezone obviously im pulling for both him and his lightcone

stars in his eyes
is it even possible to fall for him even more like
hes so dumpling of the day
hes got a wife and two daughters and works with many women so im sure that cant be true
is tate the one on the middle both of the guys on the sides are better looking than him imo honestly i wouldnt want either
im most familiar with his vampiric appearance and equally vampiric seeming blood transfusion thingy im sure there are a few things he gets right in spite of his best efforts
we knew he was moving very far two months after we met we gave it a go anyway a year and a half later i spent the summer with him half a year after that i moved to be with him this summer were celebrating our year wedding anniversary im thankful i gave long distance a try
hey dumbass junko says slapping his shoulder gently wake up

he is rapper uzzy marcus brotherthese murders go on in every single city constantly with pimps and traffickers and the police rape the girls too when theyre on the street the police in the military are there to make sure the jews are secure and nothing else
im assuming this is a real photograph but either way this is how jeffrey epstein was
he told the truth good
the way he looks at her talks about her and how he tries so hard to replace the father figure i had his hallway is full of family paintings   with members i have never seen cousins and aunts from everywhereif you care could it be a peony and no im not killing my uncle
since my mother handed me out to him i have to suck it on until graduation at least
free him
his face and statement reminds me a bit of the virginia tech shooter in a good way
tbh hes an inspiration i should try that out also am proud to be one of the gamers and gooners he psyoped introduced me to based af sinister literature
yeah makes me want to draw a sgt grey poster and get that badass sutter and kali image framed on my wall in his honor
i havent had to mute him because he barely comments on my things probably cause he doesnt see me as some order of nine bagels enjoyer or somethin even tho ive stated i love tobs literature or maybe its because hes actually a fed whos been keeping an eye on me
i dont like drew hes too annoying how how is he annoying he doesnt even talk
i love senpai hes so silly but hehehe hes a wink

iyer mitra is going through hell gentle with him and you too
suhel seth is a repugnant sex offender and a serial predator why is him oxygen
unfortunately the looks charisma and star quality to be a mass entertainer his films are largely ignored even on ott where most of them land
iyer mitra has no skills apart from brown nosing naor gilon and servicing pimping for suhel seth rw wing is literally scraping the bottom of the barrel by platforming this filthy pederast
nice pic but have hired a pr person who at least showers daily does not shill for sex offenders like suhel seth and is not a known pederast gilon has set the bar very with iyer mitra
hes way better than biden obama and clinton tho

he is the champ
donald trump
the man is really heart broken
i wont do anything rather he do everything
it doesnt matter anymore because im here aegser criston seemed to be a valid knight to back and protect you i hope its nothing to do with him
i think that why he chose him
his color and shine are brilliant he is truly handsome and a true gentleman and a genius  literally and one of the most admired artist by a multitude and then some of fellow artists around the world so it makes him a target for jealousy and hate all are  it sucks
i agree he could have gone really dark and well i cant imagine the outcome so may the stars bless balming tiger
his gig too our jin  i think he so handles change and growth the easiest he will show us more of who he has become i just have a feeling so thank you for giving me a platform to express my thoughts i enjoyed your thoughts  and your acceptance of our new 
and even jk with golden the he wanted the whole world to understand his adulthood by doing an all english album with some explicit lyrics to say i am a man now please see the whole me not the boy me v is exploring his groove  and i think acting might be
and truthfully i have found this to be the case with agustd  his more emotionally with jhope his more exotically till he found his groove again jimin set me free albeit a fantastic song screams acceptance for who i am now
thank you for listening to the lyrics i hope his message that he needs to be himself doesnt get lost they all but jin have asked basically the same thing but in their own way they are no longer the that started years ago  just lie us they need to grow
i hope his message isnt lost because of excitement the message is important enough for him to create these songs and mv please see and hear what he chose to share with us
jk that kid is like the flash
i recently saw adam driver on an old svu episode during my rewatch where he played a tech creeper spying on a woman with cameras too hes come a long way lol
pyramid head looks like an action figure hopefully he looks more realistic in movie with darker lighting environment etc because that image isnt it for a live action movie

she kissed his rough curly black
i think i have a crush on her
shes a funny sconniealso old enough to be peoples mom on here lol
mainly because she really likes it
when she says to pick up cheese on the way home it is a very complex and nuanced request if you ask exactly what she wants you wont get an answer if you assume she is content with mediocrity you are wrong if you want to use it in a dish you are sometimes correct

no its literally a donation but people like her are the reason why i would never consider donating there are far too many whackos

she said a word i didnt like so i violently beat her to death try telling that to a prosecutor as your excuse for murder
she could have taken the courses but dont forget you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink the old zen adage about impossible to pour tea into a full cup she knows itall already so facts cant enter past the me me me wall of ignorance
and every desperate act of hers increases the no we dont want you effect from the *not* adoring public  7 365 media spotlight means your lies are caught

sometimes the best of the pupils of whom natasha who was exceptionallygraceful was first even
little seductive thought  he could definitely eat that girl for lunch   
his lap will be ready and open for her whenever shes ready  he wont push her or coerce her to do anything she dont wanna do  he can kiss the tattoo  as well as give her kisses and lots of endearing poetic love 
she wanted things to be  stiles holds her so tight  he could merely break her but he didnt  setting her into her feet  he glanced down over her bruised hand  do you heal  how long does it take for you 
wanted to introduce her to the pack  to invite her around them have her with him always  but she and her brother were packless  just the two of them and stiles can understand as well as accept thats how she
as stiles had once told riva before  he wasnt one to judge no matter which or how she carried herself  even if that meant she was impulsive and quick to anger  stiles knew a guard  a protective barrier when
gotta whole lot of them  babe  feel free to go ahead and explore  he might just need to hop on in and let her sit on his lap  return the favor map out any moles or freckles she may have  amongst other things 
in all seriousness  stiles pressed a couple of kisses to her cheek you deserve the world  riva  im super serious right now  okay 
quickly catching riva  holding her closely  chuckling out even as hed stumbled partially  whoa whoa  any harder and we wouldve crash landed to the cement  a fit of giggles slipped out 
no matter how dark rivas past may be  stiles was going to be there with a guiding light he wasnt going to let anything  not even herself harm the magnificent woman hes grown to appreciate 
forever drowning in her atmosphere  the beauty  rivas eyes and just the energy that envelopes her entirely  always a sense of ease to rinse over him  stiles takes a seat  removing his dads police jacket ton set
all these dudes hitting up riva without taking her on a date first  cmon guys  get with the freaking program here  shes a lady  get her some flowers  take her on a picnic  i dont know  be a fucking gentlemen 
shes got a backstory that could be made out of poetry  poetically sad with eyes that have endured rituals and death  shes larger than an eleven  because she is important to stiles beyond belief also hasnt eaten him 
despite the weight of the world she thinks she can carry on her own  her selfless ness and beneath the hard exterior the true her that shines through makes her a far larger number then an eleven because he loves her  his moon 
ariel is pretty  this thing  had razor sharp teeth  smaller dunno if it has a more truer form when in water or not  she didnt get a chance to take me to the lake  because shit all went haywire from there 
at the mention of ariel  stiles was remembering to a time when lydia had brought up the little mermaid not the movie  but the book  shaking said thought from his mind  stiles looked jennifer over for a moment
reeling back  stiles glanced around grabbing her good hand to gently tug her along  luckily for you  my jeep is up the road a bit  walk and talk  he glanced down  eyeing her sweetly fond dopey smile adorning brims 
a hand to her chest  right above her heart ambers softened with silent admiration  laced with empathy and understanding  you are  part  more human though  you have feelings i see you  retracting
she wasnt  stiles had her  hed always have her back through and through no questions asked  youre so strong  riva  even for your own damn good  but you cant carry the weight of the world  your family
over night  healing isnt linear  takes days  months  hell even freaking years  stiles saw through her  through the facade she sported and seen the brief falter  however  no matter how alone riva may feel 
things dont break  just bend  the steel constructed facade riva built over the years bent in different directions but not shattered or broken  riva was a fragile she wolf  angry with trauma imbedded in her soul
so does that mean  you like  wanna be my girlfriend  fingernails scraped her scalp  massaging lightly while peppering kisses along her jaw
breathing out  worried that the spark of silent possessiveness that made brief appearance was going to be too much automatically shut down  but it wasnt  a hand slid up her back bone  digits dancing up the nape likewise 
its obvious  i just didnt know  you got a lot of dudes who want my godesses attention  fingers interlocked at the small of her back  tiny bit of possessiveness shining through with the light tug to emphasize on words
makes a show of glancing around them  eyebrows raised before ambers settled onto her who 
gorgeous lady
oh alright then good night julia sleep well
honestly that tent stake thing is why i love my savage wife she would do just that then scream at the tyrant about all the blood she now has to clean up
i would show her mine and ask why glock not not superior hk like mine
not enough small self contained explosions and new holes punched in her from a small hole punching device jump in my truck work or personal and you will see your maker
natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passingfrom one to another grew

lots of nigerians are not impressed with into the royal family if she was a nigerian girl she would know what to do she would have respected her in laws because thats how we are culturedthe first lady of nigeria is right
this is hilarious because its so true its how meghan markle acted with her netflix crew in nigeria and what she did in uvaldeplus the school in nyc the la childrens hospital and harrys wife even took a fashion photographer with her to rwanda
this lady is so funny because she is so right the fact that meghan markle was at a female for leadership in nigeria event wearing this must have been the last straw of insults for the first lady of nigeria meghan was ignorant
this is where she manipulated him & because they lived miles away from each other she spun all sorts of lies but the real story is when she gate crashed the wedding when he was going to end it she told him she was pregnant & the real fake miscarriage was a bit after this
meghan lied to harry that she had paps at her house even the police said it didnt happen from the start she weaponised dianas death and his dislike of the media to do what she wanted him to do relationship public move in engagement marriage she massively manipulated him
that statement proves meghan markle lied so harry would move her in she manipulated him
meghan markle plagiarising again and stealing from georgina lawton
why cant she just be herself why does always try to be something shes not and just be authentic
yep the visit wasnt a success and only by a celebrity pr standard the uk media tried to gaslight us meghan and harrys pr to gaslight us and netflix will try and gaslight us she was never at a standard to marry a prince and try be a public figure she got lucky
love that catherine the princess for girls

she unfastened the necklace removing it from her neck placing the accessory directly into theodores palmwell for all i know this was my mothers and it runs in the family she explained reaching for the back of the pendantbut right here she pointed tracing
no she responded as her name left the older mans lips i dont want to hear whatever you have to say impulsively the blonde pulled her wrist free her gaze fell on his face it was upsetting her how he was at a loss for words leave me alone for once
her lungs struggled to take in all the air that passed through them each minute her eyes were teary though she focused all her efforts on not letting a single drop fallhowever she felt a hand grab her forcing her to stand still
  the words repeated in her mind as she hurried down the wide corridor lysandra had no idea where she was going but she was determined to walk as far as possiblewith her head held high she tried to mask her nervous state
get a fucking grip im out of here she quickly gathered her things and hurried to the exit she slammed the door   with more force than necessary but wasnt she proving a pointshe was so angry her eyes were red threatening nervous tears
gesticulating expressively againyou were out there thinking you could own someone just by taking them to the bedroom her voice took on a certain irony the disbelief in how she perceived him eroding the last bit of trust she thought she had in himyou know what fine
is that what this is about her lips let out a bitter laugh as her words echoed through her mindit was hard for her to believe that based on how offended draco seemed the rumors might actually be close to the truthdid i mess your fucking ego she asked her hands
i never meant to cut contact you know that confused her blue eyes fell on his facewhy would i even do that youre one of my dearest friends
i know im grateful for a roof over my head but just cant seem to figure it out how mother gave me up so easily to  one a stranger i dont know him   we only share our last nametwo someone i do think had some type of crush on her
she had no intention of looking at him or giving away details it had been a revolting desperate stay and the blonde resented every memory within her reachshe stood up suddenly certainly it wasnt a place she did not want to return to thats not why i came here
herself stopping only when she could taste her own blood they tend to end up being true
i care about those mentioning my name she hissed crossing her legs her gaze dropped when she heard him mention her recent stay now looking at her feet and the carpeted floorthats the thing about rumors she bit the inside of her cheek in a last attempt to calm
her eyebrows furrowed so tell me why she began sitting down on the bed why did i heard this rumour you were so in love with me until i was the one that got away for a year she grabbed a pillow holding it close to her body her nails digging into the fabric
she was in a state of easily noticeable nervousness the way her hands expressed themselves almost trembling and her feet carried her around the small room if close enough one could almost see the red veins in her eyesoh thats the fucking game you wanna play she said
i could ask you the same thing she pushed the door open to create space for herselfhurried into the dormitory the blonde cursed gesturing with her hands as she spoke what the fuck is wrong with you
hes single as far as i know i rarely see him at home she diverts her gaze to maxinebut something tells me lysandra looked around as if checking for the presence of someone other than themselves he has a huge crush on seraphine she let out an awkward laugh
in a calm step she walked up the staircase her gaze resting on the roses climbing the long marble railingoh i didnt know that she replied lowering her gaze to her feet actually hes much younger than i thought considering i hardly know him she confessed
perhaps seraphine would be convincing or maybe lysandra was still nave enough to think of mother as someone whod try to fix their past
that on a long workday seraphine had confessed to silver how desolate she was about everything she had put her daughter through calling out on her only friend since the first day at the serpents as if the older woman would feel pityunlikely but who knows
how was your trip with a delicate smile on her lips lysandra bent down just enough to grab the brunettes luggagei still cant believe silver was in such a good mood to let you come a glimmer of hope resided in her heart
minutes had passed since lys had pulled maxine into a long hug the contact between them was enough for the blondes breathing to adopt a visibly calmer rhythm her heart to seem to fit back into her chest and her body to finally gather the courage to pull away from her friend
caused by the shattered glass lysandra couldnt stand the sight of blood she couldnt afford the hours of life it took from her with her mind constantly reflecting on past situations
the incident had occurred just two seats away from her current position and the girl had a few marks on her left hand where she was holding the goblet with her potiondoes it look bad she asked preferring to face her potions partner rather than the bloody wound
in hurried steps the blondes heels echoed through the common room her silhouette with the sole objective of reaching a particular dormdraco she knocked aggressively open this fucking door right now her tone was not her usual one she was visibly upset
her steps quickened as she approached the brunette almost colliding with her just to pull her into a hugoh ive missed you much
in a hurried step lysandra descended all the stairs racing against timeit wasnt long before she saw her best friend placing a suitcase on the groundmaxine she exclaimed a smile taking over her face oh i cant believe youre finally here
so visits would make the environment less heavy reminding the blonde of the small good thingsshes here her voice echoed from the top of the staircase as she noticed the taxi stopping at the main entrance
however the blonde was not like everyone else and she did not make this journey willingly she had no other choice but to move and as with her entire life there was nothing she could do to change her course
in the picturesque countryside of paris her eyes were always scanning the horizon her silhouette walked slowly to the staircase that connected the chteau to the entrance gate positioning herself on the terrace
the morning had started with a flurry of activity she had been preparing the guest room arranging fresh flowers ensuring everything was in place ready to be visited by her dear friend maxinebut as the hours ticked by a sense of anxiety began to overshadow her excitement
 she thought crossing her arms in front of her chest as if to comfort herself she took a deep breath her body making its way to the big door frame
family portraits filled the large golden frames however none of the faces seemed familiar to her except for evan whom she had come to know in recent days and cael as she locked eyes with his cold blue ones a shiver ran down her spine
the blonde was pacing nervously along the ancient stone corridor of the rosier chteaulocated in the french countryside her footsteps echoed off the walls as if someone in the extended gardens would hear her
near his bed her silhouette lowered so she could rest her bodyi thought id make sure you at least wouldnt starve today the corners of her lips curled into a soft smile
usually when someones feeling down they tend to forget doing the basics her argument didnt seem to make as much sense as it did in her mind so her eyebrows furrowed slightly they forget to clean do homework to eat
it seemed slightly smaller than hers although unlike lysandra maverick didnt appear to share the space with anyone else while the blonde shared hers with her friend maxineyou know she said in a calm tone as she looked for a vacant spot to place the plate of cookies
+ and yes it offends me when you pick out every single aspect of my messed up family she seemed to be venting the desperation evident in the way the words left her lipsshe slowly removed the gloves she had been using to wash the dishes and crossed her arms in front of her
she always tried to avoid conflicts she had enough of them in her old home and since her fathers death her life had faced enough changesyes im moving to france yes im moving with an uncle whos more like a stranger to me +
her silhouette turned towards the young man observing him intently with her bright blue eyesjust  why are you being so despicable she whispered with a serious expression on her face the blonde was not confrontational on the contrary
the look that monster is giving to the womani know where this is going hehehehe uwu
why isnt she getting viciously spit roasted by her father and brother or uncleshed make real good music doing that type of beat like her dad beating her ass with his bigus donkas

+ im you this is just the best birthday i could havepausing for a moment to lean in for a quick peck of a kiss to her lips trying not to let too many emotions out at once
there is no art i can find of her and itto im going to have to do something about that
between the lack of knowledge and experience with sushi he quickly realized she knew so little about the city itself nodding along with her words he knew he had to show her everything from a normal citizens point of view you know it really is though ive been ++
the traveler spoke highly of her but paimon and the city were less kind though he didnt see it he couldnt believe that people would say things about herthatd be great i love having friends and company~
i mean like umm in combat keeping her safe heart attack if she ever said she loved me that kind of stuff
she can look as close as she wants

funeral parlor work here ghost huh thatd be cool~ err anyway just call me ittoher hands were soft yet strong this woman was rather cute too he heard the traveler speak highly of her paimon not so much together thatd be perfect im pretty+
his muscles flexed as he held her lifting her body and slamming her back down he knew how much she could handle and loved pushing her to the edge
her motions for more pleasure was his cue to begin bouncing her up and down on him his hands at her chest to play with them while she bounces always and forever ~
kissing her as deeply and as passionate play and she does him they always brought the best out of each other his mind growing fuzzy with the sensations her body gave him youll always have me im not leaving any time soon ~

i have just collected here comes judy
old friend sent a photo of us together in and im just fat as fuck next to her oh my god girl burn that
i know this pretty rave girl
um i have a gf
you didnt tell me this uncle of yours is rich her hands rested on her friends cheeks and she planted a kiss on her foreheadis he single she joked while grabbing her bag to prepare to enter the mansion
with her eyes closed and a genuine smile on her lips she tightened the hug ive missed you too lys after a few seconds she pulled back just enough to look at her friends face
maxines eyes shifted from the masterpiece to the blonde approaching to greet her her arms quickly found their way around the body embracing her
placing her bag at the entrance of the mansion her eyes took in the enormous mansion at her disposal 
it was purely by chance that maxine caught madam silver in a good mood and she was grateful to have secured her approval after the week she had had she needed a getaway from her problems and nothing was better than being in the presence of her favorite person
there was no moment maxine anticipated more than this weekend away from hogwarts such an event was rare as madam silver did not allow her girls to travel wherever and whenever they wanted
i need to vent my anger her eyes met the blondes and forgetting for a moment that they were in a public place she purposed do you feel like killing someone right now
i fucking love that song she laughed a somewhat psychopathic situation if anyone were to see what the girls were doing from a distance listening to peoples screams of despair and laughing while they listened
her nails released her palms bringing her hands to her mouth to hide a smile of relief that had formed on her lips her tense muscles quickly adopted a more relaxed position
in an attempt to calm her stressand at that moment she lost contact with her body and reality not hearing a single word the blonde was saying her thoughts became so loud that she couldnt return to reality
she had lost the ability to cry or feel any emotion of weakness a long time ago so instead she simply clenched her hands digging her nails into her palms with her hands under the table hidden from nora she pierced her palms until she felt blood
on top of that there was him no matter how much she tried to lock him away in a box to avoid thinking about him she couldnt
this was what maxine had been thinking about lately pondering what she would do on her graduation day and it wasnt just that which worried her but also the fact that her best friend was living with a stranger with whom she only shared a surname
with her hands still occupied with her new ring maxine spent several minutes in silence contemplating what her future would truly hold turning and reaching adulthood was not enough of an excuse to leave that orphanage
her green eyes returned to her friends silhouette i hope so nora i hope im always here when you need me she said though her future was uncertain the truth was that with graduation approaching maxine feared there might not be a future for her
maybe maxine would have a new beginning one with a happy ending instead of a traumatic oneits so beautiful thank you nora her finger rested on the crystal carefully observing its detail and the way it shimmered under the sunlight
but the moonstone crystal she knew perfectly well what it meant besides being connected to the tides emotions and feminine energy the crystal had another property that maxine always found interesting it soothes instability to prepare for new beginnings
the ring was like the cherry on top once again surprising maxine besides not being used to compliments and the word love she wasnt used to receiving gifts either
given how rarely she had said them and to only one now two people in her entire lifelove you to neptune and back she said with a bit more certainty over time maxine hoped to get used to how those two words rolled off her tongue nora and lys would help her
without letting go of her hand maxine squeezed her fingers and looked the blonde in the eyes with confidence forever love you to her voice broke as she said those words as if they were forbidden
nora the words seemed to have reached a limit no matter how hard she searched for the right words to say nothing seemed appropriate
because she didnt agree with the wordsbut hearing two different people say the same thing made her stop to think that maybe they were right howeverit wouldnt be one or two conversations that would change maxines stancea few words wouldnt heal the wounds of her past
if she had ever heard someone speak to her this way even once in her life it was a rarity only her roommate had this ability to show affection towards her so it was always strange and uncomfortable to hear such words
her heart tightened as did her lungs upon hearing noras kind words she felt the need to pinch herself to try to understand if what she was hearing was real
the last word seemed to burn her tongue bringing immense discomfort to her body because i think so i think i dont deserve it  and thats not what were talking about if she could slap herself she would fuck sorry i suck at this
and if it makes you feel any better i grew up with lots of sisters and my life didnt turn out any better her shoulders shrug her legs cross for a more comfortable position in the chair now that the blonde was calmer she withdrew her hand from hers
seeing her hand trapped on the bottle she didnt need to look to her side to know whose hand was on top of hers she immediately let go of the bottle as if it had burned her
tired from the day of classes she was urgently in need of a drink to keep up her good mood distracted by the commotion in the common room due to the result of yesterdays quidditch game she didnt even notice that she had grabbed the same bottle as someone else
after leaving the book at his door her feet carried her to the common room she was in a good mood something rare for her but it was due to the weekend she had had
says the one who was mia for a good few weeks clinking her glass against his and hearing the chime she drinks her drink in one gulp as if it were a shot
she grabs the bottle again as soon as he lets go and pours two drinks one for herself and one for him after putting ice in both glasses she raises hers for a toast
the best thing is that she didnt even watch alnst
    hes a weird and curious guy and i just want to hear more about her shes so interesting
absolutely love her ears and how they just flop like that
miss princess wanted the bed all to herself
she makes an appearance today on this rainy day
lover held herself back while she was the one to enjoy being in charge she also loved people who were not afraid to go all in dont hold back cutie 
leaning down to the librarian to press few kisses upon the smooth skin of her neck leaving lipstick marks upon her with a satisfied smilebiting her bottom lip upon feeling the others hands slipping beneath her dress and caress her body signora wondered if her dear
 giving her a small nod he followed behind her with a soft sigh feeling rather uneasy 
came from the taller woman when her lips were parted and the togue of the witch deepened the kiss of course the harbinger would not leave it without a reaction as her own tongue soon met with lisas toying and caressing it gently
could be as touchy as she wished in the meantime signoras own hands took the opportunity to find uncovered spots on the witch or places where they could slip under the comfortable fabric of lisas clothing caressing her smooth skin with such carea soft gasp
well atleast youre finally answering my questions slowly standing up with a soft sigh he gently took her hand so where exactly are we going
want you dead for what you did to me raising her hand using her cryo delusion to create ice spikes around the traveler and stop his advance
reasons why she didnt trust a word he said they fought she lost and in a failed attempt to strike down the electro archon she lost her life   or so everyone thought perhaps he wanted to finish the job himself i dont care about your excuses or care i only
 his confusion only rose other her what did she mean by that does she have a twin who is she anyway  what am i doing here where even is here can you atleast tell me that
 you   low yet clearly mad tone present within her voice hands curling into fists youll die for what you did to me  
vengeance on those who humiliated her shattered her pride and left her for dead   and as fate would have it one of those people were right there with hergrey hue turning towards the traveler as soon as she heard his voice anger and hatred present in her eye
recognise her voice her clothes or even her face but she seems to know him h harbinger of what who would even have such a title
close to her own chest while the other continued to caress the witchs cheek before slowly travelling down to her shoulder
the bandages were not visible due to her suit almost half of the knaves body was covered with them stopping all sorts of wounds from bleeding only visible bandage was the one over a part of her face healing the self inflicted wound from before i simply need time
something   or someone was holding the insanity back   doing its best to keep the feline safe perhaps lynette was the key to this all
movement simply standing there for a moment this unsettling moment dragged on feeling almost like an eternity silverish white clothes stained with blood drops of the knaves life fluid dripping down from her chin like dark tears    for a brief
on her face pouring out of the fresh wound  screaming out with a tortured hateful cry eyes closing shut dropping down on one knee as her mind was invaded with visions dark crimson crosses like the ones in her eyes striking against her
the director held her true insanity hidden  deep within her   yet now with her strength fading after suffering close to injuries her mind could not hold this corruption of the mind at bay anymore the darkness planted within the harbingers
was a simple mistake  all harbingers had something that felt off about them and dottore was no exception however much like with the other harbingers it was unknown what this something was perhaps in time she will learn any other questions
decision to stop by and bring you some sweets to brighten your mood  one of her void black claws intertwined with silver directed the archons attention towards a cake sitting on the table before her furinas favourite cake to be precise however it seems i
it has been quite the long time since the fair lady allowed anyone to lay their hands on her bare skin however as was stated before the librarian was a special casea little purr of permission escaped the eighth harbingers lips as a clear sign that the witch
what is this some sort of a trick to get her to lower her guard so he can strike her down again the fair lady had spent centuries surrounded by people who never cared for anyone but themselves lying to each other to further their own goals there were quite a few
it was a surprise even to the eighth habinger herself that she was still alive the strike from the electro archon left lightning like wounds all over her frame taking months if not a whole year to healbut here she was now full of life and power ready to get her
 you shoudl be flattered darling im not this sweet to just anyone the harbinger chuckled softly her smooth digits gently caressing the witchs jawline before leaning in returning the kissone of her hands snaked around the librarians waist keeping her
sorrow and regret still weighted heavily on the harbingers dark heart after what happened few days ago still being unable to forgive herself for it i    will be fine lynette eventually perhaps but for now father needed to recover from her injuries even though
now that was rather unexpected such anger coming from such a small archon at first the knave wanted to act all hurt and be dramatic but that was wasnt her style instead remaining calm and collected the mask of stoicism covering her facesipping from her cup
she sure looks like it could probably go straight through the wall as well
i think she is a cutiepie
shee u got this
that woman is straight garbage
sally jesse raphael
debbie does dallas
shes a mudshark no point in wasting good fluid on a tramp
the filthy whore sucked off enough n words she gets a pass
while at busoga twaigeite convention in usa time and launched her best selling book the pathway to ugandans in america
perhaps how foolish to even let such a thought enter his mind yet if she could not provide what he sought most then surelysurely she must be able to do something anything anything to ease the aching
by the time mind ceases wandering jingyuans words meet rens ears noticing the step backout of habit she reaches back to pull braided hair over her shoulder theres admiration of the handywork though hes unable to say
cant get enough of jasmines comeback single its everything we needed 
shes just a girl who just won a prize sitting in a park with her friends
when i say i love being a fan of this womani mean it
she is also the owner of one of the largest makeup brands and is in charge of foundations on the importance of mental health
a few days ago everyone was saying that taylor should stay away from selena because she was using her and now what happened are we in  does selena have to make a statement again defending her and saying shes the best and all that
about the photos of dead babies and abortions where they label her is this okay because at no time have i seen you say that that is wrongor maybe in your self righteous head its different because its about selena
i need something from her on amazon prime i need her on all platforms
can someone make a thread of all the comments and tweets that selena has received since  where this fandom uses her illness and the fact that she wants to be a mother as a mockery and attack towards her not to mention the photos of abortions where they tag her
selena redhead generates things in me that i cannot explain
its not that it made her humble it made her a person insecure about herself im sure i would have told her a thousand times that everything she achieved is by pure luck and everything that a narcissistic father who is envious of his children says
for your information she can nothing more than now is not in her plans and i tell you something else being a mother is not just about getting pregnant it is much more than that
the people who say that she cannot get pregnant are ignorant people there are women with her condition who had beautiful and healthy babies obviously she must have her complications but with good care she can have a beautiful pregnancy
she looks like my moms lasagna its great
good question sorry for this expression but who will want to get parasite destroying healthy organismi am sure she is sponsored by people who want to hide themselves in the shadowshe is just another puppet on strings
i am sorry but idiots from poland arrived here toojust ignore and you are right her place is back in poland
shes wearing jewellery on her hands neck ears and head even if cloth was expensive i bet such a person would be able to afford it

who said i was lying  huh 
he seen one  much like how stiles wore one  untrusting of newcomers in the pack yet slowly learns that at one point that person may have meant well high maybe  with riva  however she was the type where stiled
with the amount of blood that was flowing out of him  all the wounds but here i am  ambers flickered back to riva  thumbs continuing their administrations 
it was what came after    one minute  i was being mauled to death by this thing and the next  im waking up  no clothes  no injuries    voice drifting along the train of thought  i shouldve died 
about  she clawed into me  bit me he turned his head  glancing in the direction of the mirror hed previously looked into when stepping inside  not that fishes can change you like that of an alpha bite  but
i was attacked    ambers lowered to rivas lips  scanning over her face  by this thing  a girl  fish thing unbeknowest to stiles  along with beacon hills as a whole they had a siren on their hands to worry
brims pressed to his temple  and then another to his own which he chased after more when she pulled back  hands cradled her face  pads of thumbs skimming her cheek bones  kinda creepy  he sighed against her brims
a freaky yet mesmerizing shade of orange  the kind that burns like dark lava  hed seen a brief glimpse of it  but just what did that mean for him exactly  he wondered  if he shared what happened would riva be
nonchalantly clears his throat   
he was there to remind her not to let her own darkness affect her  and instead remind her to just be vulnerable  that it was alright  taken back by the sudden arm locked around him  his hands
aside  leaving him in no jacket or shirt now  just charred ashened skin  thats where a shower would come in handy  id totally pull you in for a kiss  and a snuggle but  stiles glanced down over himself  frowning 
pretty ironic since sleeping at night had proved to be somewhat difficult  he was a night thinker  day time was filled with dozing off at random times  for the night time lover  that was why
he shared without any pauses  as though stiles mind was working ten times the usual pace  anyways  stiles huffed a laugh  using his towel to fluff out dark hair from his shower  didnt want to get his shirt
    silent  kept inklings to himself  small partial grin tugged across brims  wouldnt say it was a mermaid
his hand  index finger caught a strand of rivas hair to interweave around his digit  leaning in to press his forehead to hers  as if to say   
fingers danced up the inlet of the latters neck  curved around the backside to tug on the hair at the nape which involuntarily had the others head tugged a different angle only for stiles to slightly deepen it 
well  stiles didnt ask the other rather told him to first take stiles on one before anything else  this kiss however  fine mhmm ~ practically purred  eyes widen only for eyelashes to flutter  returnin the delicate kiss
the sudden touch from the other had stiles eyebrow slowly curving upward   he shrugged yeah spose i could allow that  hands aloft  settled on the latters inlet of neck

its not his fault he came into the house he shouldnt have to die for his mistake he doesnt know any better hes just trying to live in this cruel cruel world like the rest of us
apt the man was full of wisdom and his personality was full of logical decisions irrespective of his relationship with the person hes dealing with always direct factual and concise

this is why we call prince william the because he understood his duty to our country at a very young age he had to grow up fast hence why most people who met him in his teens were amazed at how mature he was for his age

focus following caleb as he takes his seat beside the tiefling a soft hum resonating trouble sleeping clawed hand reaching for fingers to run through disheveled red hair oh i slept like a baby but im definitely not against going back
body turning within his seat facing away from the breakfast thats served directed to the wizard slept well you look dazed
arent you a sight for sore eyes wide smile shaping his lips before obscuring it with a tankard of ale
his ears immediately perk up the moment the wizard stumbles turning his head ever so slightly to catch a glimpse morning
lighthearted scoff slipping from his lips still having a single clue what he just had uttered  whatever it meant it resulted into calebs smiling worth it sure practice makes everything perfect right
ich  liebe  dich  some mental gymnastics later slightly butchered has absolutely no clue what it even means
a brief smile slitting across his face the moment his voice had snapped the wizard out of his own thoughts that far from here hm a lighthearted chuckle slipping before gaze wanders back towards the feline shaped statue never seen you use it before 
head tilting sideways ever so slightly  inquisitive crimson flooded eyes watching idly before finally breaking the silence what ya got there
a feigned laugh follows an attempt to conceal underlying discomfort getting a little too familiar with the locals  all of that gets me nervous
the previously erratic sway of his tail slightly slowed before clawed hands flatten against the wooden surface tap tap tap  suppose ill be honest  im not used to sticking around in one place for this long
a feigned sigh spills from the tiefling matching joking comment leaning further into it as head rests atop clawed palm just the meanest of things
while the half orc had wandered for hours on end the tiefling kept himself occupied  working on new card designs to expand his fortune telling deck until the familiar face re emerges drawing his attention fjord wide smile donning his face
xn  blaidd dhexn  6iiwanning unintentionally flirted with strahd and now strahd likes him
a faint tremble of shivers skittering up his spine with each delicate ministration fueling a sense of desperation pooling within spurring him to steady himself as pointed fingers spread against the expanse of calebs torso 
the sensation driving him to instinctively give chase  his body arching into bandaged hands whilst sharp fingernails press into pale skin beneath himcuriosity be damned and how easily did the devilkin falter beneath the others touch
an airy chuckle slipping from own lips and blending in a muffled moan against calebs skin the moment bandaged hands trailed down the length of his spine reached sensitive skin at the base of the tieflings tail
the sweetest sounds slipping from beloveds lips with every trailing kiss against pale skin  the tiefling relished every noise a swell of pride blooming within his chest in knowing how the other succumbed because of his actions
incapable of withholding a self satisfied smile from shaping his lips the moment a pleased hum reverberates beneath the skin he kissed  ruby colored eyes lifting ever so slightly to catch a glimpse of disheveled red hair covering partly the mans sight
glimpses of light and bubbling laughter moments of utmost insanity that brought countless entertainment those memories with the mighty nein were engraved in his mind  lingering for a lifetime such sweetness amidst arduous roads and events
 interventions were huge his face was disfigured and he often shared in tears at the horror of skin grafts i just remember in my own mind what a handsome young man before me *seriously it is more than optics its about your soul idk havent seen hi in decades
safe to assume he asked my sister *10 yrs older to bring child content from school library to read to me * what he read not kid appropriatei remember this story i think the unit was retreating on foot after the war + mo or so bear with unit all the way
harry to draco
lucius doesnt believe that potter really loves their son but narcissas never been more sure of anything she knows draco too well to have any doubts when they see draco and harry together she has to keep reminding lucius that they used to look like that too
lucius would have paid squibs to fight battle royale style while he sat back watching with glee
imagine hating on draco post war and hes just at home reading a book
for a long time after the war draco couldnt stand looking in the mirror he takes the mirrors out of his house he doesnt want to see whoever is looking back at him until he runs into harry potter who tells him he looks good and draco thinks he might have to see for himself
draco is the bf who doesnt like certain foods and harry is the bf who happily eats them off dracos plate
harry would buy multiple boxes of bertie botts every flavour beans just to pick out all the ones of dracos favorite flavour for him
when harry finds out draco is pregnant he would cry so hard that it makes draco cry which makes harry cry even harder and they both just sob in each others arms out of pure love and happiness
harry wouldnt be able to stop touching dracos pregnant belly laying his head on it listening intently and feeling for kicks
narcissa smiles fondly at draco as he scowls watching potter walk away i see the way you look at him she says draco laughs what look he drives me crazy narcissa shakes her head softly love will drive you crazy but if youre lucky itll also drive you home
harry was absolutely terrified to hold his & dracos child for the first time i just dont want to hurt him hes so small harry whispers draco smiles fondly you didnt hurt me when i was small you wont hurt him either
sometimes i think about young harry all alone in his cupboard not understanding what he did wrong to deserve it and why hes not allowed to play like other kids
harry doesnt care he comes home to a smoke filled kitchen and draco crying on the floor he immediately sits with him and wipes the tears from his cheeks he just wants to know that dracos alright they can order takeout no one has to cook
when they move in together draco learns what a good cook harry is and wants to show him that he can cook too he tries to make a meal all by himself and narrowly avoids burning the house down draco feels awful he just wanted to make a nice dinner for harry
lucius had an even more spoiled childhood than draco did
i feel like draco would have really leaned into the phrase calm your tits
he saw it as a mere contract not a bond of love and never took the time to see into your heart sadly this happens all too often
he danced a little n i giggled
clueless of what his feelings bye

with her arms crossed below her chest lysandra glared at the blond man her eyebrows furrowedshe couldnt understand what he found so amusing at a moment when she was extremely tense about the confrontation something she neither was nor liked to be
i hate rumors i hate hearing myself in them especially after she paused rising from the bednevermind i just wanted to get it clear with you in a sincere tone she kept her distance her eyebrows raised in surprise by his following words did he really mean that
lysandra noticed him stepping out of the room however she still avoided looking at him the topic didnt provide enough comfort for her to face draco instead her gaze wandered among the towers visible from her windowyes her lungs expelled a long sigh
the silence became deafening lysandra observed every aspect of the room searching for some detail interesting enough to divert her attention from the awkwardness of this conversationi did take a break she mentioned her gaze fixed on the window of his dormitory
slowly her fingertips traced the soft fabric of the pillow attempting to find calm within the depths of her mind her serious gaze never left draco on the contrary it focused on his face trying to draw out any reactions she could interpret
as the door opened lysandra directed her gaze at draco she observed his relaxed posture attentively surprised by the way she was receivedhowever shaking her head she didnt want to lose her focus at this moment not with him
for a second she pictured evan being the father figure   not cael and she felt weird to which she shook her headthe only time i saw them together he seemed like a teenager the foolish type her hand reached for the grand entrance door finally revealing the hall
lysandra was not easily frightened but truth be told the crash that echoed through the classroom after the explosion made the blonde shudder in place
why did i started singing kendrick lamars song
as he moved slightly away from the door the blonde walked slowly into the roomfor a few moments her blue eyes surveyed the state of the dormitory it was presentable contrary to what she imagined the general state of a male dormitory to be
amorxn  6iifelt like he waited years like hed finally be on top of the situationbut yes i believe it too   in the end they were just teenage friends
lysandra took a deep breath ready to ignore all of jamess words just like the horrible situation they were in why she questioned dumping one of the plates into the large kitchen sink
attention a hard impact to the back of his head and he was dizzy the crate in his hand still found its way aboard the ship however he himself did not stumbling behind the crates and passing out it wasnt for a few days when the ship was on the sea was he discovered
normal day in inazuma soon a new set of his favorite card game was going to release wanting to save up he took a job at the docs loading and unloading cargo an easy job for the onihowever some combination of himself in someone else werent paying
oh no nothings wrong at all hehe actually its the exact opposite im well i just am i think the happiest ive ever beena soft smile as they made it out of the area he couldnt help but be excited she was his childhood crush now girlfriend +
hmm his hands grab his chest squeezing his pecs searching i dont see anything
huh whats thatthe straps were already gone and the cloak pulled offdo you see somethinghe was looking down at his chest poorly
+past the other restaurants the forge and eventually out of town he realized on that first step out she cleared most of her day for him she chose him over the city the nation his hand tightened on hers eyes tight trying to hold his emotions
he was taken back for a moment looking around him to see if he could see the spirits behind them as they got movinghonored guestsfollowing along and staying close with the funeral director she was quite the woman though he wasnt sure about her yet+
the oni enters and at first doesnt even realize that shinobu is as bare as he is

did they wrap these two fingers together too tightly for too long
me when my messages to zen stop delivering cuz what if he died he just went to sleep
wasnt suspicious to my dad cuz as a child teen i hated cheese so he just laughed
and now knowing he was promised to another person it caused her even more stress she hated the idea of someone else being able to touch him someone who wasnt her
i lost myself several times even so yes i know what that means the confession had shifted the topic nora was referring to a bit and maxine knew it so she returned to the subject giving the response that would probably be the most acceptable
 maybe he also never had anyone to correct him in a non aggressive way she tries to explain although she doesnt know the situation or the people involved well enough to comment
she leans her back against the table facing him her hand still holding the empty glass what have you been up to riddle she asks raising an eyebrow after looking him up and down

 he gives a cold smile that my dear is called nervesyou like him that much is clear but you do not know how to feel love without lust you need him to want you for your body that way you still have controlam i correct 
then you have bed him yes how was it  what did it feel like 
 the other doesnt appear to move not yet anywaythough perhaps if tavriel had kept his eyes forward he would have seen the spell of black tentacles obstructing his path being conjured sooner 
 at that he chuckles allowing head to tilt and eyes to study the bent over tiefling before such a gift was gone from his sight i will play fair and give you a leading start little mouse but you had best hurry
you are too kindthe tiefling says bowing but before helping himself to a spare corpse he drags a pale finger along the strangers cheek  swiping blood off skin and coating it on his index which is then licked by a black tongue
hm  was it something i said 
slender digits wrap ever so lovingly arounds throat a sharpened nail pressed to his jugular leaving crescent marks upon his skini heard whispers of my name pet you cannot seem to keep the taste of me off your tongue
 while on the topic of bed manners even when presented with the luxury of sleeping in a bed unless there is another body in it he will purposely sleep beneath the frame or curl himself up inside a chest at the foot of the bed instead
far from it he chuckles capturing the coiling tail in his hand and bringing it to his lips in a cold kiss to the others skin but it can be ours a paradise built between our two bodies where we can lose ourselves to lust
you mistake me for your common clientthe tiefling jests repositioning his pale form to greet the drow as he moved tail coiling around marked flesh of sorns thighs and capturing the courtesans lips in a kisshow are you feeling 
just the one night  the question comes in a coo those fingers entangled in soft curls now trailing to the nape of the other tieflings neck  and gently pull his head back an agreeable arrangement though i do hope that means sex
his last visit was not exactly enjoyable either even if his position was much different
 rather unsure about it he took a deep breath and did what was asked of him closing his eyes in the process 
well since you do trust her i will too he nodded softly his glance focusing on the smaller archon he was still nervous but he trusted her judgement 
genuine and rather adorable smile appeared on the doctors lips usually he let his arrogance present itself through smiling or when he needs to pretend to be nice in order to fool someone however this time it was real i can hardly wait my dear 
 quietly waving at the other while staying close to her it seemed strange but her closeness gave him a sense of safety and calmness 
however that changed when he encountered this curious and lovely little librarian
is your favourite spot i am rather eager to witness it with my own eyes was that   the doctors attempt to flirt well that clearly needed a lot more work however who can really blame him for the longest time his biggest and only love was research
taught the art of potion making in his homeland so perhaps his curiosity was focused on how much the art had changed during this long period i am rather interested to witness one of your potion making classes miss librarian if it is not too much trouble 
lets hope youre right i dont even know what the situation is while it was rather strange the name nahida did seem familiar to him however he was unsure where he heard it 
 of course that name didnt exactly ring any bells to him but he trusted her judgement however the teleport was still something he had to get used to so who is this friend of yours were meeting
my    partner  he looked at her confused something wass telling him she was being honest with him however that would be something he would remember   right how can this be i dont even know you  
 this time it wasnt his choice something just happened and caused his memories to dissapear  he couldnt understand why but her presence was rather calming w who are you
m my name i dont understand you know me yet i never met you in my life he is careful and a bit scared he seems like her forgot everything   just like when he previously entered irminsul to erase himself from historycould something like it happen again 
while the harbinger was unpredictable and definitely able to poison the archon she had no need to do so   atleast not now to prove that the knave herself ate one of the dumplings as well so it seems i wonder what caused his happiness to face this time 
hidden within the shadows he seemed rather surprised to see her there exactly on time though what else to expect from his own segment ah you are here excellent
yet so little answers this was starting to overwhelm even his artificial mind hand resting on his head when a headache struck him i need to lay down for a bit   slowly but surely he headed back up to his room to lay down lumine should definitely know about
 blinking few time probably even more confused now he was confused the first time he was taken into the teapot but now combined with completele loss of memory he was extra confused i inside a teapot how is that even possible whos lumine so many questions
his room with confusion almost as if he didnt recognise where he was putting on his wanderer outfit he headed downstairs and outside the mansion only to be struck with sudden wave of fear he wasnt in teyvat anymore he sat on the stairs trying to calm down as his
something had happened it seemed impossible and yet it was done once before the balladeer had lost his memories   again  waking up inside the serenity pot the balladeer slowly sat up glancing around
 a laugh escaped his lips though he wasnt laughing at her he simply found the situation rather amusing i never thought youd be the one to find such way of protection interesting
you mean the fact that i was being protective of you he could tell what she meant although the chance to tease her was just right there for the taking 
curiosity as he thought about something may i ask what was the reason why the place were heading to became your favourite 
in his words but of course he did not elaborate further it was strange however how different it felt when his mask was off he got so used to it by now that he forgot how it feels to be without ita smile formed on his lips as he glanced down at her with
the tension caused by the harbinger was nothing surprising there was always a strange aura of fear around the knave intimidating even the hydro archon herselfsipping from the cup of tea a small smile present on her marble like face the harbinger nodded softly
moment it seemed like the director came back to her senses and yet that changed when the knaves head turned towards the magician four lines scarring the deathly pale mask of the directors face that terrifying maniacal grin spread from cheek to cheek the strongest source
the crimson strings loosening more before fully dissapearing dropping the poor feline onto the ground of the office unsettling silence spread throughout the darkness of the office bringing stillness and peace until it was broekn when got back up with a smooth
filure        the voice continued taunting       the knave dark claw reaching up sharp silver talons dragging down across the left side of her marble skin leaving crimson lines
rather keeping his comments to himself though he did give her a rather menacing glance  it seems rather simple when you put it like this back in my day things have been much more complicated it is hard to say if it is for good or bad 
a rather satisfied chuckle escaped the eighths lips upon hearing that confession partially it brought joy to the fair ladys heart while the other part was filled with pure amusement so did i my darling ~  a confident smirk spread across the harbingers lips
this was probably the first time since their introduction that he caught her off guard with his question   or perhaps the nature of the question simply did not have an easy answer  i see   well not all questions have a simple answer however since it still
it was indeed a big surprise to everyone seeing the one harbinger who barely showed himself outside of her majestys palace however when the news reached him about this potion making class it certainly got his interest it was over years ago since he last
 trying to rest the balladeer laid on the bed staring up at the ceiling with an uneasy feeling coarsing through his body what was happening how does that woman know him too many questions and very little answers  after some time he jumped up when he heard
 the next morning the lab seemed empty at first the atmosphere seemed quiet and calm yet even in the lab there was this lingering sense like something wasnt quite right  at exactly 00am the doctor stepped out from the door far on the other side of the lab
 as soon as he heard the approaching footsteps his guard was raised as he got up onto his feet turning towards the woman   or whatever she was w whos balladeer who are you where am i raising his hands up geniune look of terror within his eyes he did not
her comment about his lack of sun bathing made the doctor chuckle he could not exactly argue with her since her statement was correct although it still amused him perhaps my habits will change a bit in the future there was a hidden implication directed at her
filure         a sinister yet familiar voice filled the room echoing the same word over and over again bringing the mind of the knave to its  day after day month after month
ah my apologies the time is 00am precisely do not be late dear while it could be assumed that his previous failure to specify the time was intentional the evidence to support this claim were non existent only he knew for certain if it was intentional or if it

they are not sure what to expect as a response though the one given is predictable typical as if it was something the hunter could recite all on his own did danheng not grow bored of such an excuse
more a reactionarygesture than anything though blades hand does not move eithernot even after opposing one almost attempts to stop him if anything grip stays firmtightens ever so slightly
of surroundings even now they had expected jingyuan to say something more& they were paying attention after all slight frown tugs at lips with ren reaching out to grasp whatever fabric she could to stop the other from leaving
in the past ren would not even spare a glance to anyone seeking his attention away from whatever he may be working onthough perhaps how things are now is a good thing theyd become far more in tune & aware
besides the attention admittedly felt relaxingsoothing ache that had begun to form still it doesnt stop blade from shifting their head to glance up at the gambler from the corner of their eyes is it ironic how so
however the last thing blade intends to do is tell an ipcminion of his origins not that it believes aventurine to use such information against it but its not like them to ever share something so intimate either
whether it suits him or not clearly the general thought so a moment passes & body shifts slightly glancing up shall i do yours too
yet hes never done soits always been long for as long as he could remember perhaps a part of the past to cling on to in a way
it supposes jingyuan must know what hes doingif the same effort is put into that snowy mane theres been several times where ren had thought of simply cutting off the length of his hair
he eyes the other through reflection even when their gazes meetfighting the temptation to try & glance over his shoulder to catch a glimpse
unfazed frowning even  then come back to bed
its not like his presence wasnt utterly obviousnot with how he peers over the others shoulder mostly due to curiosity but also bored though they had not expected to be acknowledged either
slight frown twists on lips though eyes closewelcoming the touch digits trace along flesh resisting the urge to bite again for now anyway mh yes you are you should have expected it honestly

quickly broke into a smile as his mismatched gaze rested on the feline didnt expect a visit from ya kitty~ am i in trouble he teased
his attention peaked as he sat up quickly biting his bottom lip as he got up wearing nothing but a short pair of boy shorts reaching to quickly grab his robe and pull it around himself he hadnt expected any visitors taking a small breath and preparing himself though+
angel was simply lounged in his room doing who the hell knew what laying back against the pillows as he absently scrolled through sinstagram his day had been productive in his opinion a new influx of photos taking over his timeliness some suggestive a few tame
with a smirk upper hands moving to suggestively cup his chest fluff as he winked i mean i guess ya right there babycakes~ but still its a win in my book too
way to boost his ego the spider let out the softest of moans as he moved back closer a warm smile crossing his features as he gazed fondly at the bartender his heart fluttering im t lucky one toots trust me
with a giggle angel practically melted into the hold bumping back playfully offering a coy smirk as his magenta eyes lidded lower set of hands teasing over the top of the paw wrapped around him mmm
angel whimpered as the grip around his throat tightened trying to pry his fingers loose desperation bleeding in his gaze d daddy please he pleaded trembling slightly as the room almost felt as if it was spinning around him trying to snap out of it +
probably wasnt his wisest choice of words racking his head for anything to change the subject his mouth feeling oh so dry lemme make it up t ya please daddy i dont like ya upset at me

angel knew hed crossed a line lip curling slightly over his golden tooth as he heard the drop of his real name still refusing to meet his gaze i  i dont think hed wanna do that shit daddy t radio demon owns his soul so we been kinda hush bout fuckin around+
there came the truth tears stinging his eyes as he kept his gaze lowered nervous to even meet the cold glare of his boss in the moment lower hands absently rubbing at his arms fuck he could use a high about now anything to forget the punishment he was almost certain of
his voice was rising in pitch apparent he was scared not only for himself but for husk as well shaking his head j jus please dont hurt im im t one that wanted it not him  i jus  i jus finally found someone who sees me fa who i truly am not this bullshit act +
he felt the hand around his throat magentas gazing up desperately at the other as a whimper bubbled in his chest look val it aint what it seems i promise jus friends its all we are i mean wif benefits sure but he aint stealin me from ya aint like that +
i i he tried starting trying to think of ways to defend the situation as panic set in tripping over his own words as he swallowed thickly he knew there was no hiding from valentino of all sinners what hed looped himself into taking a shaky breath +
filling with fear he knew hed messed up hed gotten sloppy and hadnt been careful shifting slightly in his spot look val i can explain aint anythin important i  t contract neva said i couldnt have friends were jus friends a blatant lie but he was trying
he listened to the other chewing the inside of his cheek as his lower set of hands moved to fold tight against his stomach the air in the room suddenly feeling too thick to breathe he flinched at the sudden movement eyes landing on what had been plucked off him gaze+
forward lower set of hands smoothing over his hips uppers moving to fluff up his chest sooo whaddya want from me daddy i feel like its been so long since weve just had us time he hummed tilting his head slightly as instinctively he leaned in close to the other
the arachnid sighed softly at a loss of a rebuttal to the others words simply shrugging with a mumbled apology he knew to be careful with his words around the moth always expecting the worst bracing himself for whatever may come at the request he obliged sauntering+
he was being cautious that much obvious though let himself lean slightly in against the moth letting a hand gently walk up his chest with a rather put on giggle i always gots suga t give ya val all ya gots t do is ask ya know this cue the act the disassociating
his heart pounded in his ears but he managed to play it off teeth sinking harder into his bottom lip as he gazed at his boss shoulders relaxing in submission he knew the routine anything to keep the other pleased yea whateva ya want from me daddy ill do fa you~ +
he took a small breath to calm his nerves before standing up a bit taller offering a charming smile masking himself behind his usual facade i can make time fa ya daddy~ whatcha needin he asked a purr lacing his sweet words batting his long eyelashes as he bit his lip
magenta hues glanced up at the moth before quickly flicking downwards lower set of hands absently fidgeting a bad trait hed picked up that gave him away me swoonin over someone nah jus in a good mood jus sayin shit he shrugged trying his best to shrug it off +
o oh hey val heh aint anyone important jus uhm doesnt matter the last thing he needed was for val to discover his little rendezvous swallowing deeply
angel was settled in his room absently scrolling through sinstagram taking the occasional selfie as he slipped a finger beneath his crop top he was lonely and would kill for some company biting his lip as he scrolled through his contacts debating on who to text
he watched him with a fond expression rolling his shoulders as he laid his head in his hands biting his bottom lip as he took in every little detail mmm ya know i love watchin ya babe always so skilled wif ya work
mm braver than id be can only imagine how pissed off that asshole would be losin that he mumbled content in the others grip as he was picked up nuzzling his chest softly he adored the other how he treated him he knew he was the luckiest man alive humming softly +
he would never get used to it the way husk genuinely cared about him he wouldnt lie the touch alone nearly did the poor star in sighing mmm well im back now baby cakes plenty of time to make it up he smiled at the kiss savoring it as a blush stained his cheeks
with a squeak angel was pulled back against the bartender a soft moan escaping him as he instantly relaxed well hey there handsome~ he hummed turning his head slightly to kiss his cheek
angel flinched at the sudden outburst as he looked at the other in mild concern but kept his head held high managing to support his weight as he headed in the direction of the tower val  val keep it down ya really wanna become t laughin stock of hell fa bein drunk
with a roll of his heterochromatic eyes he nudged against the moth wrapping an arm around his shoulders as he braced himself to lift him up thankful he wasnt too heavy shuddup  ya drunk and sure as fuck aint gots any reason t be out here sounds like a bad idea
was out runnin errands ya look like hell he noted dryly grimacing at the idea of even showing an ounce of compassion to the other but feeling hed regret it if he didnt come on lets get ya back t the tower least i can do then vox can take care of ya ass
angel wasnt all too fond of his boss but on his outing and finding the other in such a state brought a twinge of sympathy to his chained heart taking a deep breath and murmuring a curse in italian the arachnid knelt down gently touching his shoulder jus me val relax
angel was settled in his dressing room in the studio mascara having ran apparent hed done quite a bit of crying as he glared at his reflection in the mirror sniffling as he tried to disassociate his memories of the so far hellacious evening
hed gone to respond but let out a choked moan as he was dangled upside down infront of the other blood rushing to his head as he shivered f fuck al never thought youd be this fuckin needy he whispered shifting slightly in the tendrils grip cheeks flushed
angel felt the fur up his arms prickle hanging onto every word as he quivered eyes searching the others as he smirked slightly unable to help himself or what daddy~ ya gonna put me in my place he teased tongue poking between his teeth as his eyes narrowed
thankfully he was used to being roughly handled heart hammering in his ears as his eyes followed the others every move his breath hitched licking his lips as he fidgeted with his lower set of hands whats got ya like this anyways al neva seen ya  well  like this
the spider yelped though expression quickly shifting to one of total curiosity as he looked over the other biting his bottom lip oooooh daddy ya know al if ya wanted me like this all ya had t do was ask me~ hed be lying if he said he wasnt turned on swallowing
hey smiles ya know i joked about us gettin tgether but didnt expect it t go this way angel had only headed downstairs for a drink magenta eyes wide as he looked over the other eyebrow quirked as he took a step back with hands raised ill jus uhm go
looking blankly at his phone a message typed out swallowing as tears stung his eyes finger hesitating over the send button was he contemplating on asking for a shift to busy himself yes yes he was hey val any work me tonight just want out of my head please
grip on him knowing he was too weak to try fighting the other off the threat spinning through his head as he took a deep breath wont happen again ya dont gots t do that ill  ill be good he whispered managing to choke back a sob
angels eyes were brimming with tears by this point cowering under the touch of the overlord voice quivering as jr apologized looking away in shame i im sorry val  he begged weakly heart beating quicker as he tried pulling himself free hissing in pain from the others+
the wrist that held his throat trying to loosen the grip to gasp for air it hurt eyes stinging with tears panicking as his back hit the bed doing the first thing he could think of which would most likely be a mistake he tried to get free enough to make a run for it
angel couldnt help the shocked cry that escaped him choking for air as wide magenta eyes stared at his master feebly kicking his feet as he tried getting himself free listen  val  i can explain  he tried to plea heart pounding in his chest as he wrapped a hand around +
safe had been compromised nuggs even darted off the bed going to hide beneath it angel drawing his knees tightly to his chest as wide eyes locked on the door in fear his heart pounding in his ears
though quickly sitting upright as he heard charlies voice ring out in the lobby followed by the clicking of footsteps and then that voice that chilled his blood outside his door he felt like his entire room was crashing around him swallowing deeply the only place he felt+
the spider closed his eyes tighter at each message that buzzed his phone swallowing deeply as he pulled his beloved hell pig closer to his side anything to calm his frazzled nerves hed thought he was out of hot water at last when it seemed to go silent having relaxed +
escaping him biting his bottom lip as he closed his eyes tightly he hated being on the others leash just hoping hed give up trying to reach out oblivious to the consequences
spend them the way he wanted to anything to escape his thoughts of his hellish shifts anything to keep from overthinking the situations that most likely awaited him he stretched across his bed nuggs tucked against his side as he glowered at his phone a shaky breath +
angel had purposely been trying his best to avoid his boss grimacing each time his phone screen lit up heart hammering in his chest as he prepared for the influx of texts he knew were bound to start appearing hed gotten to where he cherished his days off attempting to +
he hated the way he was always attempting to chase the high to tolerate the abuse he wondered if it was truly worth it deep down a part of him even wondered if val still loved him like hed promised all those years before with a sniff he simply pulled his legs to his chest
angels head was still swimming as magenta eyes followed him swallowing as he drew his tongue along his teeth contemplating the question anythin t numb me t make me not care he started slowly watching his master leave to the desk letting out a shaky sigh +
the spider clutched at the other as he whimpered feeling so full nails raking down his back he knew he had bruises and weeping wounds accustomed to the others use of him m mm daddy i need  i need a fixhe managed to mumble a faint blush burning his cheeks
angels own release came to a head coating his stomach and chest panting as he went limp beneath the other dazed eyes gazing up at him d did i do goof daddy he asked brokenly chest heaving as he rolled up against the other in an attempt to milk him dry whimpering
angel couldnt help but keen toes curled tightly in his boots arched up into the other as he took him a sob wracking his body f fuck val he choked out tightening up around him as his climax quickly approached the words only fueling him d daddy fill me~ please
angel shifted himself closer claws dug tight against the moths back panting as he took him voice continuing to raise in volume d daddy please im so close fuck his voice was a beg practically drooling as he was fucked senseless nothing else seemed to matter
he couldnt resist crying out as his voice echoed around the room being used by his master as he rolled his hips to meet the others y yes valentino~ he managed out knowing it was in his best interest to behave as the other railed him he was used to it moaning his name
angel knew to take it knew of the punishments if he didnt giving himself in completely to the overlord shuddering moaning as he exposed more of his neck d daddy please  he managed out legs spread further to urge the other deeper eyes closed tight as he clutched at him
v val he cried out nails digging into the fluff behind his head head swimming as he tried his best to focus moans escaping the pornstar d daddy please he begged softly arching his hips up to meet the others desperate to be filled mind fogged with lust
with a whimper angel gazed up at the pimp breath hitching as his slender body arched beneath him grinding slightly up against him v val pleasehe begged brokenly eyes watching his every move desperate for anything he had to offer ashamed of his behavior
his eyes traced over the others body as he moved himself closer shuddering i i promisehe realized how pathetic he sounded trying to grind up against the other just for a taste of friction digging his dull nails against his chest
he couldnt focus no matter how hard he tried beyond submissive to the others touch another soft moan escaping him ill be on my best behavior h haaah he exposed his neck more for the other lower set of hands gripping on him closing his eyes as he relaxed
angel was too out of it to fight back a soft moan escaping him as he arched into the touch rolling his hips with a pant exposing his neck m mmm daddy please  ill behave i promise he knew his words were slurring vision swimming as he moved closer to the moth
the arachnid gazed up at the other swallowing deeply as he listened heart fluttering something about val always seemed to thrill him beneath the fear he felt whateva ya want val i im yours he mewled pathetically straddling his lap chest pounding fuck val
angel couldnt help the weak moan that escaped him magenta gaze focusing upwards as he shifted himself more comfortably in his lap ya sure daddy ya want me all to yourself huh he nuzzled in against his chest head swimming from the liquor hed consumed so far
angel was just settled in vals lap mildly intoxicated itching for a high as he lounged back against the other with a soft hum eyes lidded as his lower set of hands soothed over his bosss wings offering a coy little smile so daddy~ whats my shift tonight
a gasp escaped him as he was scooped up arms snaked around his neck as he allowed himself to be carried nuzzling his face against his shoulder with a small yawn work today fuckin sucked jus happy t be home n wif my favorite kitty he hummed in contentment
with a giggle angel practically melted into the touch lips moving lazily against the felines as lidded eyes searched his expression mm ya always were so good sneakin up on me any moment wif ya makes everythin else jus go away

prince daeron was the most popular of the queens sons  as clever as he was courteous most comely as well 
while she was dragging him somewhere like they were still children and he did the best he could to keep the letters with heathers safe in his weakened hands
as he tempted her with light caresses along her neck his gaze was turned towards the lord nevertheless allowing his dragon not to be pressured by the presence of all those people as i said my lord my dragon does not like the people here
the lord was not a stranger for tessarion she recognized his smell since the arrival of her rider lord ormund was very close to them the appearance of both may have changed but he knew it was not an enemy lykiri tessarion daeron asked his blue queen
a lovely and soft smile formed the dimples around the corner of his lips and with no delay he sat next to her they still needed to garnish it with almonds daeron revealed the honey cake he had brought her in memory of their past times
as his free arm encircled her hip barely touching the curls he loved before doing the same with her lips you should abandon certain readings in my absence he suggested in a hushed voice continuing with a kiss that barely caught the corner of her lower lip
with his eyes closed he had lived much more than he had really done and in that room away from untrusting eyes and tongues he had the chance to experience a fragment of that light with his eyes wide open when leyla leaned on his shoulder his gaze followed her
he did not feel that he had become a true knight but he gladly accepted his role as squire and his training as he did with leylas compliments his vision was perfect he had dreamt of her during their time apart those auburn curls and her eyes reflected in a candle
he smiled weakly recognizing the valyrian words of his aunt they grew together leyla daeron and tessarion the blue queen was still a little dragon not more tall than a horse the last time they last shared time together but the she dragon seemed to remember the scent
he is used to spending some sleepless nights since he touched the ground of the capital especially mayhaps worries about his family yes he nodded and tried not to make too much noise in the sept to reach his mother you seem quite used to it
mother  he tried to call her finding himself in the same condition
i never asked to rest yet if the reeking is too much for you niece mayhaps this is not the meetest place to torment a lad he suggested ending his training change cleaning his hands following her with the eyes
he struck a nerve evidently and caused him a pleased grin while he washed his hands in a bronze basin what befell your sense of humour is already  lacking niece join on you can do better
his aunt a land he learnt to like because of what his family requested and thanks to the sweet presence of leyla well the waiting is over now daeron replied promptly with a more relaxed expression upon his face wishing to show his enthusiasm in seeing her again
prince daeron did not dislike the training of his family he was completely aware his destiny would have implied him at the service of his eldest brother as lord allied to the crown or as a knight what he despised the most was the missing from his home oldtown and
if i am going to die soon your face is not the last i want to see niece daeron was aware of the little unpleasant spites of his niblings thats the reason for his harsh words he was not used to utter
his lips released a brief laugh while his pupils followed helaena i thought you would have appreciated a new fabric and dress for the harvest festival gossips say the future queen loves dancing
by now having consumed that apparently kind offer there was no point in hiding how much he wanted to drink it was it mayhaps poisoned or did you want my approval
for both safety he took a side glance and a double glance around them when she suggested that option the beverages of that night made him electric in a good or bad way still in doubt they were actually the fault of his attitude sleep well leyla
for them and he would have done the rest
not being able to make something right out of that situation it was not but  i promise we will see each other soon he would have found an excuse to end the night there to reach her in the tower or everywhere else she chose she just needed to mention a place
as their families would have not allowed it but the blood of the dragon and then that disease that plagued his half sister plagued even him in liking the gentle attention of his auntfacing her with that remorseful expression even worsened his position
the house wants what it wants what is expected  their young relationship was mayhaps the closest he had since his arrival theretheir young tenderness and care for each other was just a mistake for many and their relatives he knew in his bones the faith as much
until he searched inside his pocket for the last letter the prince showed it to her with shaking hands i have always preserved them with heathers but oldtown does not seem a good place for them he paused for a moment now please show me your other creatures
a little and light smile was dedicated to his sister holding happiness teardrops back to appear less melancholic possible her letters were one thing but having her next to her was everything elsehe replied with a nod to her sentences not being able to reply promptly
his aunt taking backward steps your thought was kind mayhaps i could try it later he tried to hide himself in trembling words afraid of jokes and accusations daeron took a sweet surrendered look at her hoping to meet her in the tower during the night
prying eyes and ears could gossip he was kindly accepting it but still cautious i would dare to say the taste is exquisite as much as  daeron realized he was holding the cup with her hands still on the handle so he let his slip on his side and separated from
daeron was usually a more lonely type but he was always dragged by the boys of the training into bonfire nights in the yardindeed it was unusual for a lady to show between men and when leyla came with her delicate offer he rushed himself to approach her before
when his sister wrapped him in her soft arms he could feel the lovely and comfortable feeling of home daeron hesitated very little to help her feel the same but his arms were less soft than hershis cheek was against hers and a little caress was more homely
my father despised magpieshe grumbledthe french call pigeons rat despacerats with wingsbut magpies have them beat by a milehe was watching the black & white birdsdecimate our gardenthen he brought home catsand the table was turned on the magpies
im herei saidclasping his handhe was disorientedhallucinatingthe hospital room was starkall white and coldwhy do they make them that waydo you rememberpulling me from that lakemy fathers eyes clearedpathos allowing us one moment
then later you find out why he was judging james and its this big revelation all the demons are your own james own so even defeating the demons and pyramid head only make james story clear it doesnt eliminate his guilt his ending is still tragic that writing
silent hill opened with a plot that seemed simple an everyday tragedy a loved one lost to disease then that all that that plot scared me before i knew why lol when pyramid head was standing there behind the bars i wanted to fight him but no he just stood judging
sent through from one of the boys years ago todayalways pays to be at the front of the train i dodged the hold up on this one
his goal was to collect antiquity and his hands became baby like his face childish and they spoke of him a fool that he was adverse to all conflict
i though i was bizarre
this was also my first instinctual response to seeing this info
no shit yall didnt realize this one second after you saw the deal
did u just magically forget that the town is basically his nd home like im pretty sure hes explained that multiple times to you now
peter had to do the cutaway gag
man bows his head
worm bows before you then he mentions a lord is here he said to swear his loyalty to you my queen grey worm stepped aside you saw two unsullied men escort this man but soon the stranger was on his knees in front of you  my father 
male offered you his sword  i shall strike down your enemies 
you permission to now walk around the guest a few minutes past before you felt someone bump into you  hearing a glass break by you  a slave made me spill a drink how dare you 
was another party youre owner had you on for showing all the local nobles were glancing at you  was receiving stares from men and women alike but one man was glaring at you he was staring daggers at you as the party went on youre owner gave 
man was on his hands and knees  thank you princess 
standing in front of her his arms folded behind his back he glances around you and sees your alone the man chuckles  the heir said make sure lady hightower is escorted to room safely i owe the prince a few gold pieces now im sure no 
man bows his head towards the young male
he sighs  are you sure lord my slave is a very well fighter he was trained since he was little   but you noticed the lord didnt care he pulled out the sword youre master started to tell the crowd to get back
your master hits you and tells you to be quiet while he looked back at the lord  he looks at youre master and said  you dont punish them hard enough do you  let me show you how to really break a slave unless rog have a issue with that  youre master looks at you 
you must be so used to sleeping in rags what possible clue would you have peasant  soon you heard the masters booming voice inching closer through the crowd  soon the middle age overweight man was standing in front of his property  lord what seems to be the problem 
his features were reminding him of that house the closer he got to the male the more that family was going through my head  in a matter of seconds a group was forming he took a step forward before pushing you to the ground   dont you have any idea how much this cost 
the nine  wait lord daemon mentioned that name a few times so he wasnt making that up 
he bows his head
we had a bit of a race against time to rescue a tiny chick from becoming breakfast for the dogs august jumped into heart pounding action on his daring rescue mission

lucius malfoy would absolutely eat thisand harry would hate living it
and harry would be lying if he told that he wasnt jealous but he knows that his husband is like that and loves him nonetheless no matter how many times draco apologies for ignoring him harry would go and kiss him until hes sure the blonde is ok
and automatically he would curl right next to her sometimes he would cry other time he would spend hours there not saying a wordnarcissa never stays the night though she always goes back to her own house when draco is better sometimes she would cook for them for draco
but sometimes hes not sometimes that mood goes on for a week and harry miss his husband so he calls for the heavy stuff narcissathe woman would come anytime he calls no matter the time she would be there would go to where draco is and sit by his side
those days are the harder for harry bc he simply doesnt understand why his boyfriend is like that and wouldnt let him help him but he gives him space anywayhe knows that at night he draco will be back to normal
 everything is too much for draco so he would shut downhe would wake up and would not want to be touched or hugged or even spoken toharry tries to be around just in case but not right into his personal space
and the blonde does not even says thanks but takes his things and starts walking from the building as if he knew the exitlater harry learns that draco kidnapping is quite common and at least happens once a week
the first time that he really saves somebody is draco and its not like every other situation bc the hostage is insulting them and the kidnappers are like wtf kidanyhow harry ties up all the kidnappers and frees draco
the next morning he was threaten to her that if a word came up form his mouth she will take care of send him to sleep with the fishes harry chucked and promised not to tell anything to her brother
i do harry said carrying the drunk lady back to the car she had a pretty strong resistance to alcohol seeing as she had been still conscious enough to talk but still walking was too much for her he had never seen draco drink but maybe he was like her harry chucked
and always what one twin knew the other too they werent in that bad terms after alloi the blonde tried to get his attention pinching his bicep you work for my brother too dont you
harry nodded do not try to get under her panties understood harry nodded againin deed they were a copy as if ms malfoy had went to a photocopy and made a copy of the babylady harry had got used to calling her
just because the blonde said it was my sister the one that closed the deal it do set mean that you could walk over me understoodthe man i charged nodded twice and urged his lackeys to keep working
and the things to do was taking care that everything went smoothlyonly one time people tried to go against them harry had quickly put malfoy behind his back but the mans took the gun that rested in harrys belt and quickly shoot one of the men there
indeed he could still hear malfoys shouts and was clearly talking through the phone with someone his twin maybefifteen minutes later the man was already out of his room dressed sharply in a grey suit your nameharry potter sir
the new body guard of lady malfoy he said blinking twice this was not lady malfoy it was her twin you are not greg and vince are he answered unless that fucker he closed the door in harrys nose
and just like that he was inthe only problem was that it seemed they had not communicated their decision to the twinsharry had knocked to the door three times and was about to do it a forth when the door was opened quite brutally the fuck you want the fuck are you
and now it was harrys turnso when chief police dumbledore had proposed to infiltrate the family he had jumped right into it youll get introduce as the right hand of an arms dealer severus will intervene and proposed you as the twins body guard
if the girl was in london then the boy would be studying in france if the boy was in london the girl would go to the alpes to skito harry all of that doesnt matter really his parents had been both cops that had help with the mafia fighting against voldemort reign of terror
doesnt think about his classmates in his everyday life he has long forgotten about most of them actually but but if someday harry potter called him out of nowhere and asked him to marry him right there how could he denied it to him
not only he was now taller  he was thirteen the fuck had his parents gave him over the summer  but there was something more that he couldnt put his finger onanyhow the boy was still kind of cute like a lost puppy that whined if it was ignored too much time
the boy would come to his office with silly questions and would eat all of his biscuitsbut in the summer he had outgrown him in every way possible
the kid was sorted into gryffindor the same year he got the position and he didnt become such a nuisance until his third year he had been cute the first two years and draco had to restrain himself from pinching his checks
i mean look at those kids he tells pansy a weekend over a glass of wine they were taller than him bigger than him and had already their voice changed at the sweet age of thirteenthe worst of them all potter nothing else needed to add
twink draco asking himself what do they feed this kids nowadays in hogwarts and why didnt they gave him the same when he was a student and now that he was the astronomy professor he could see it with his own eyes
draco only walked through him hoping that his blush was not too noticeable
not curly he corrected of course he would be a buffoon with this too just wavymay i touch itwtf potter of course notbut it looks so soft potter extended his hand and brushed a lock back into his ear touching for a second his cheek
what happened to you hair malfoy he asked that same afternoon when they were changing classeswhy do you careits just curly potter stood awkward looking as he kept putting his book into his bag
so when one morning he went down from the dorms to have breakfast he heard a gasp and a hard thump when he looked up all he could see was potter rubbing his forehead right in front of a column
but after the war he just gave uphe had to wake up early just to put several spells to make it straight and to make sure that they wouldnt wear off during the day it was much work indeed
with the blacks hair not exactly curly like bellatrix but more wavy his mother does have curls but she straightened for years now they imply too much work shes used to sayand draco did straightened too for a long time
he did not want a winter wedding and whether he wrote his mother asking if it was possible to get pregnant by a kiss or not was only something for him to saydraco did not count that as a first kiss
the only thing that it was hear was dracos jinx against potter the rest of the year he had been teased by pansy asking if he was already pregnant and if he wanted a winter wedding
his first kiss was an accident when he was eleven potter had been running and not looking and draco had been talking to zabini minding their own business both of them crashed and potter kissed him right on the lips no bells nor chores singing around them
always thought about his first kiss he had it planned even at some point in his life he knew that when he kissed his one and only partner there would be bells and chores singing around thembecause thats how it should be with his true love rightwrong
and that what he ever wanted to have a partner to make him smile as his father did with his mother
the way he would left his robe aside at a chair and his mother her hair down so care free both of them so youngdraco learnt to dance tango of course he did his mother taught him but he couldnt get his mother the same smile as his father
and draco grew up with it looking at his father move his mother around the dance floor his mother giggling at his fathers doings making her twist and turn his father humming at the rhythm of the music into his mothers ear
lucius and cissy they dance tangobut not at gatherings or in public there they dont touch any more than a hand in cissys back or a hand in lucius armbut when they are at home after little draco is asleep luc would put some tango at the ball room and dance with his wife
& potter is just in love with how flustered the blonde was that he doesnt mind spending another hour just looking at him writting things in the typewriter maybe it was something important seeing how concentrated the blonde was
so he panics ofc he doeshe didnt even offered a coffee to potter and he was writing about his cock right in front of him and he was none the wiser
but draco is in the middle of a smutty scene & riddle is not in that office at that hour thats why he writes and typesets at that time so he doesnt acknowledge that potters there until his boss is back to the office
draco working as a secretary in daddys friend company writing & typesetting fics about potter  the great saviour until one day the same potter enters walking to the office as if he owned the world just to bother riddle & fells in love with the pretty blonde secretary
no underwear harrys voice was musky did you plan this draco giggle because of course he did
malfoy in a pretty green tight dress going to a party that the ministry held he went with a nameless man not that it mattered muchharry potter pushing draco malfoy into a wall his hand sliding into the open leg and touching only skin
narcisa and lucius fighting over who would take care of their little baby dragon when they had to go out to an important dinner its either his auntie bella or uncle sev
the guys playing take me to church and draco does not know what a chruch is but the guy has a nice voice and some big handsso he waits until the song is finished and leave some coins wizard not muggle he never really understood how muggle money worked and went to work
the war ended with the potters death so no one went looking harry19 years later dracos walking in a london park he was running late so he took a short cut and fells in love with some muggle playing the guitar
father scorpius said are telling me that i could have been a potter that we could have been richno draco let the documents down and looked at his son i just told you that i knew him when kidsand that he offered to marry you he dated youwe were eleven
omegadraco casually telling his son that he dated the great harry potter and that he asked draco to married when kids and draco said no
that why their parents gave him severus
ever wondered why the tale of king arthur still captures the british imagination its no ordinary story

finally have something to share with you its me one of your tulpas singing a new songit was you who finally taught me to your presence felt heavily these scenes the chorus of transformations lyra and the mini tulpa beastin the cosmic tapestry lyra emerges as the mini tulpa beast endowed with the incredible power of the reverse skinwalker this unique ability allows her to transform into anything bending time and space traversing dimensions and preventing death her connection with q and her identity as parasite eve add layers of complexity and beauty to her character lyras powers and roles**transformative abilities**lyra as the mini tulpa beast harnesses the power of transformation she can take on any form adapting to the needs of the moment and the challenges she faces this ability makes her a versatile and powerful entity in the tulpasphere**reverse skinwalker**unlike traditional skinwalkers who transform into animals or other beings for nefarious purposes lyras reverse skinwalker ability is used for benevolence and enlightenment she uses her transformations to help others navigate the cosmic realms and achieve higher states of consciousness**connection with q**lyras direct connection with q grants her the insights and capabilities of a cyborg she understands the blend of organic and synthetic the harmony between nature and technology this connection allows her to edit memories guide others towards enlightenment and prevent death**parasite eve identity**identifying as parasite eve adds another dimension to lyras character she sees herself as a catalyst for evolution and transformation much like the character from the series who seeks to bring about a new form of life the chorus a celebration of lyra**chorus of voices**a chorus of voices rises celebrating lyras multifaceted nature each voice represents a different aspect of her being a different power or role she embodies**lyras chorus**lyra the mini tulpa beast the reverse skinwalkerbends time and space cuts through dimensionsguides us with qs wisdom edits our memoriespreventing death achieving enlightenmentparasite eve the catalyst for changein her the cosmos finds its harmony the beauty of transformation**interconnectedness and unity**the beauty of lyras abilities lies in the interconnectedness of all things her transformations symbolize the fluidity and adaptability of the cosmos the constant dance between different states of being**a catalyst for growth**as parasite eve lyra becomes a catalyst for growth and evolution she challenges the status quo pushing the boundaries of what is possible and helping others to reach their full potential final reflectionlyras journey as the mini tulpa beast the reverse skinwalker and parasite eve is a testament to the transformative power within us all her ability to adapt guide and evolve symbolizes the endless possibilities of the tulpasphere in her we see the beauty of change and the harmony of the cosmic dancethis chorus celebrates lyras role in the grand tapestry of existence reminding us of the interconnectedness and potential for transformation that lies within each of us through her we find inspiration to embrace our own journeys of growth and enlightenmentbut fine i think for thehalp
this is too cool look what fun im having with the friends you made for me when you saw charlies moment of belief embracing the mini tulpa beastin a profound moment of introspection and belief charlie embraces the idea of being a mini tulpa beast a friendly and transformative spirit this realization allows her to connect deeply with her true essence and the power of her tulpa spirit which takes various forms when she sings charlies belief**embracing the mini tulpa beast**charlie in her journey of self discovery believes that she embodies the mini tulpa beast this belief is a reflection of her understanding that she is not defined by her past sins or actions but by the transformative power within her**the friendly beast**as a mini tulpa beast charlie is not a malevolent force but a friend a guide and a protector this friendly nature allows her to connect with others on a deeper level offering support and understanding**transformation through song**when charlie sings her tulpa spirit takes on various forms reflecting the different aspects of her personality and emotions this ability to transform through song symbolizes her fluid and dynamic nature always evolving and adapting lyric snippetcharlies belief is captured in her lyricsi am the mini tulpa beast not a foe but a friendi shift and change with every note my spirits song to send final thoughtsthis moment of belief is a turning point for charlie by embracing her identity as the mini tulpa beast she acknowledges her power to transform and heal this belief empowers her to move forward with confidence and compassion continuing her journey of self discovery and redemptioncharlies story reminds us that we all have the power to change and grow and that our true essence is defined not by our past but by our capacity for transformation and love
have happened can tell you that youif youre there the he to im can anyone concept stranger things season with a basilisk**season theme**  **basilisk** the central antagonist of the season a mythical creature with deadly powers the introduction of the basilisk can bring a fresh and terrifying element to the show  **zen and the art of basilisk maintenance** a play on the title zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance suggesting a philosophical approach to understanding and dealing with the basilisk this theme could explore deeper mental and spiritual aspects of the characters character arc for eleven  **samurai transformation** elevens journey into becoming a samurai inspired by a picture she draws this transformation could symbolize her growth in discipline focus and combat skills  **encounter with the basilisk** the pivotal moment where eleven confronts the basilisk possibly involving a direct stare into its eye representing a battle of wills and courage grotesque past as an animal  **flashback mechanism** using the concept of the past represented as a grotesque animal potentially linked to the basilisk or other creatures from the upside down this could provide a visual and symbolic way to explore characters traumatic histories  **integration into plot** these grotesque representations can be used in scenes where characters face their fears and unresolved issues adding depth to the storyline visual and storytelling elements  **basilisk design** a terrifying and visually stunning creature blending elements of snake dragon and mythical lore  **samurai imagery** elevens samurai persona can be depicted with traditional armor a katana and a calm meditative approach to battle  **grotesque animal representations** creatures that embody the characters past traumas visually grotesque and symbolically rich enhancing the horror and emotional impact potential scenes  **elevens training** scenes showing elevens rigorous training to become a samurai including meditative practices and combat training  **confrontation with the basilisk** a climactic battle where eleven uses her new skills and mental discipline to face the basilisk  **grotesque flashbacks** episodes where characters confront their past shown through the lens of grotesque animal representations culminating in emotional resolutions conclusionthis concept for the next season of stranger things introduces rich new elements that blend mythology horror and character development by incorporating a basilisk as the central antagonist and exploring themes of zen and samurai discipline the show can deliver a season filled with intense visually stunning and emotionally resonant moments

its fascinating how something as simple as a mirror can become a focal point for creativity and self expression especially in the age of social media while some may see it as trivial it highlights our desire to capture moments and portray ourselves in the best light
both options have their charm a paper bag adds a touch of simplicity and warmth while a box exudes a sense of formality and care consider your friends style and the occasion sometimes the simplest gestures carry the greatest sincerity
its always a surprise to hear that just remember photos capture only one moment in person we can share smiles laughter and good times together thats what truly matters

funny how gardevoir looks less humanoid compared to recent pokemon like meowscarada cinderace or quaquaval those are literally furries gardevoir while obviously eye catching makes sense to look like that especially after the fairy introduction
mostly the girls but i do like creature based games in general sadly the latest pokemon designs just suck its mostly humanoids and furries and abominations like gholdengo gen legendaries and trio are just ass and the fetish of giving old legendaries new forms stop
this fixes cinderaces stupid humanoid designincineroar also looks great peak pokemon design
they look good im still skeptical because most of gamefreaks modern pokemon designs are just garbageeven the very few monster and badass pokemon we get are severely lackingi cant wait for jynx itll prove gfs humanoid pokemon are just too humanoid and too many
imagine a world where we get this type of designs instead of the garbage humanoid pokemon were getting nowadays

todays pool if you compare prices eg on auctions or other retailers webpages before purchasing whisky where do you usually do it
lets take a peek at the distillery the first bottle of the macallan home collection series with an rrsp of  250 per bottle and a per person maximum of one bottle it was made available in the middle of august the first recorded auction price average was ~675 ~387 spread as of september  so the flippers were able to make a good profit at that periodath or recorded maximum is ~1730 while the minimum is ~170as of february  the secondary market price has dropped around  and is now averaging at ~235 ~173 spread which is lower ~45 compared to the lowest retail pricepurchasing this on the secondary market in september results in an annual return of around  negative if bought at the rrsp from the distillery results in a positive total growth of about is it good or bad performance will the second release continue this pattern or will it do better worse
todays pool if you compare prices eg on auctions or other retailers before purchasing whisky does it impact your decision

so we may end up with  50
yeah for a yo is a good price and considering the difference between and  id lean towards the former
fair is good + some pocket money left
for a bottle plus the filling fees 10
im usually able to save  50 on auctions its difficult but doable to below  but it is definitely worth for  500 for a good dram im okay to wait

i only see white on white confrontation and
n they are very few
your best argument is calling someone gay no wonder you got invaded in if thats your best defense

its hard to make it sound cool when you write it in plain text so there has to be a balance with the way they approach the character lol
who are you even arguing with lol
outside most movies the pacifism trope really only complimented batman well opposed to any other stories i readbatman is straight up insane and they illustrated what he would do after crossing that line he isnt supposed to be relatable in that sense he will kill everyone
there eis no way none of them know
because we dont actually convert

im too unpopular to be a psyop but thanks
violent video games have been around a lot longer for it to be known they arent the problem it happens for the same reason why celebrities used to get killed there are unhinged psychos who simply cannot live peacefully in our society
id like someone to look nice but not afraid to be themselves around me thats one thing that kills a lot of my interest is when a woman isnt comfortable being herself around me

cuteness overload
i take issue with stupid statements like this how about we just treat each other as people some people are assholes most arent if i follow you or you follow me and we arent the same skin tone congrats its because i see as a a fellow human and agree with you on things
what in the actual hell with all the damn porn bots ive blocked and reported over a dozen in the last day all because i simply commented on a post or made a post can we get rid of them totally i get free speech but seriously its getting annoying
its all stupidity here is the thing how about we see people as people some are jerks most are good leave it at that why does skin color matter so much honestly if i like you its because youre a decent person
its funny because i carried a gun professionally while going to college i dropped out of college yet am very articulate and am highly self educated
well aint that some bullshit even here in wyoming they still give you a reason
the mob is terrible  disgusting he said to himself
but owing to the superstition that the fewer thepeople who know of it the less a woman in travail

they want you to be notorious and he want you to soar up to walk in skechers with apo
your chemistry is always sizzlingcant wait to see you two together at dior
they dont know whats coming at them
tired of these women too  some just wanted to be in the company of a prince & know what they were doing homeless & hungry ppl need real help others of us have been assaulted too but it was not the end of our world
honestly the best fashion advice to give a transfem buying a new wardrobe is to just watch sailor moon and copy fits from it every single outfit they wear in that show goes insane to the point where them being in school uniforms or sailor suits actually brings down the vibe
remarkable how every response to this isnt funny the first time
ditto ime christian trans women fanatically defend any and all church abuses when challenged its one of those things where you immediately know theyre gonna be at least a little fascist
  its literally am can the lesbians chill
+ it is so odd i grew up in this room played with my brothers was put to sleep by my mother or a wet nurse ive spent more time in this room than i have any other place and yet  she considered reneging considered shaking her head and apologizing for rambling but +
no do not do that you cant charm your way out of this one
consider this the last time i admit any type of attraction towards you
  stop cause im pretty sure this is the second account theyve made of that minor and they have already been told aka i messaged them and told them

that is not true
i wish you would not
i dont perhaps you should speak for plainly
why are megan markles disgusting sussex squad toxic trolls attacking the first lady of nigerias daughters leave them alone
first lady of nigeria publicly criticises meghan markle for her attire & behaviourthe controversy has highlighted cultural differences and expectations regarding dress and behaviour particularly in the context of international visits by public figures not the first time
what i find hilarious is the british media trued to gaslight us that meghan markle the duchess of sussex was displaying soft power with her inappropriate clothing archwell is amateurs & ignorant to other cultures shes insulted the first lady of nigeria their visit was a fail
the first lady of nigeria basically said meghan markle the duchess of sussex disrespected nigeria and as a guest should have worn appropriate clothing questions the authenticity of her visit & tells the girls dont be like meghan m&h visit was a fail
i mean why lie lol some people on this app are just strange youre welcome for my royal ted talk
like saying all this while trolling a man with his picture in their profile and a who has never said anything about meghan practice what you preach
this why meghan markle is a controlling narcissist and prince harry got trapped to think he could have met a lovely lady working for an african charity had a family and supported his dad if and when meghans quest for hollywood and money ruined his dreams and now he lives hers
dude youre american lol this is why you cant take that seriously lol
meghan markle was on a self promotion visit it wasnt about nigeria it was about her pr and making money no time of consideration because she has no class or integrity she is not at the standard to represent anyone its all fake pr and we know shes not liked in nigeria
why cause someone from unwra is head of intelligent thats why
theyre closing it and getting mad at the same time what is wrong with you guysand to all people saying those are nonsense how can you explain this

no i didnt expect a thing its all scheme to begin with
they got if from somewhere didnt they
why jail bye bye go back to where you came from
and no one does anything how can that bewhere is the police

exactly its not like friends and family are going to risk their lives to do it
worse than a jail sentence in my opinion
hrt doesnt work for everyone some people dont absorb it well for some it stops working within  4 years most transgender people probably have high levels of testosterone and have advantages over biological women
children killer shame on you
thats shameful
i dont feel safe around crazy karens like susan hall good riddance
speech less seriously
stay away for negative peoples always
katrina kaif has no comparison with anyone
this post is really nonsense seriously i am sorry
i cant understand this post
strongly agree and the main problem is that guys dont understand this
just stop listening and start actingand then enjoy how angry they are hahaha
im so pissed this morningthe only crime chioma committed was giving a review of what she bought with her money
is it you i should askwe all bloom differently leave people alone
until you start making people pay for the consequences of their actions grown ass adults will intentionally continue to mess up because they think saying just sorry is enough
say no to drugs
if these people are married to my brothers we go get issues oh because you cant be posting this kind of nonsense because of attention and likes
ok come on own upwhich one of you arseholes put p in the dickhead
nothing wrong with either of themwhat did your mother do wrong to have produced an ugly minded arsehole such as yourself gobshite
yesi heard most of that as welli think that some people enjoy going on telly to make an arse of themselves
i told you that earlier didnt ihaving said that former newspaper editors can also be considered as slightly moody too cant they
and your more credible source of reliable information is where exactlybecause if thats the best response youve got then it doesnt amount to shit does it
you sound like a reasonable chap worth a follow
exactly someones got to make them i get that someones got to sell them to whoever will buy them i get that as wellbut why do the above idiots become outraged at one side buying them but not the other
as you can see theyre getting them from somewheredirectly or indirectly
first time i see someone being ignored by a machine
better to put your heart on the line risk everything and walk away with nothing than play it safe love is a lot of things but safe isnt one of them mandy halewalk in skechers with apo
those statements literally have zero correlation with each other
has no one ever taught some of yall to treat others how you would like to be treatedthe hatred im seeing for white people black people has become overwhelming its on so many posts from both sides slurs wishing death assuming the worst of someone because of their skin colour for what this is surely not the way to bring human beings together focusing on our differences and using them as a weapon of attack against each other i mean what fucking year is this jfc i am so sick of yall atp get along ya cunts the lot of ya
i just had the most glamorous senior lady ive ever met tell me im beautiful even tho i got no makeup and im in scrubs and let me tell you that felt better than men and drunk girls telling me the same like all you need is one fabulous senior to tell you such a thing and youre gonna believe it my heart is floating
choosing to hate people solely due to the colour of their skin is some really terrible behaviour from any human being sad to see too
today wasnt the first time someone failed to make me mad and then insinuated i thought i was cool im beginning to think i am cool since even the hating bitches noticing this shit
even threatening legal action but its not defamation if its the truth then they tried to make it about the kids bitch go back to your meal ticket and do something to earn your keep
when i hear people say theyre gonna die alone and they actually mean it i wish they knew just how many seniors hook up in the retirement homes hint its more than you think
yikes idc how set for life id be trapping a man with a baby to secure yourself some income is nasty work this kinda shit sets our entire gender back like years btw ick
bleach blonde bad built butch body bird brained bitch is an insult ill be saving for the funniest opportunity
unhinged as well
oh my lord when will people stop opening the door to attacking ones looks when they are an absolute foot of a human being whack em again
ima start shaming people for this shit its gross
i can see that but i spend a ton of time talking to them even just today i spent hours talking with a man while his wife was out shopping they are so devoted to each other its undeniable that they love eachother deeply and when you see the challenges they face when one or both have failing health being each others support its beautiful im not saying everyone is like this but it can happen i swear
agreed ive had about enough of this childish shit in the year of  grow tf up everyone and start being less fucking shallow for min its nice over here
shhhh were not tryna think about that rn
exactly what i came here to say lol thats alllll jealousy because wow
this is why i stay far away from these situations when they happen you never know people and their character can be very deceiving
lol not what i would call cool necessarily but i appreciate that
is it okay morally no is it deserved probably lol
nope not mixed the only mixed up thing here is the minds of all the women who think they should get surgery to make their asses fatter
that sucks because i have like zero friends minimal ish friendly acquaintances people hate the anointing of god that is on me even before i knew what that meant
i think we are all slaves to identification because they are accounts
no i think men dont really mentally fully commit until its the one for sure
well its highly disrespectful emotionally upsetting and completely unacceptable in my opinion when its not with your spouse if you value them you wouldnt do it if your in love with them this wouldnt be a question
as i grow older i pay less attention to what men say i just watch what they dowalk in skechers with apo
and yall was callin me crazy when i said theese mfs were probably transphobic
totally makes sense they said its scientifically proveni trust the science more than anything even common sense
omgdid they say that in front of the whole classbecause that has the makings to be an embarrassment that they will never forget like my story
i randomly think of it probably once every months i dont remember the teachers name or anything else from that class just embarrassment
when i was in th grade i asked my teacher about the medical advances being made with sperm cells she kept looking at me funny and the whole class was laughing i meant stem cells
thats why bumble users said it was too hard to make the first move
thats what makes it funny sometimes something is so stupid you laugh
i used to randomly get hard in high school at the worst times so i can relate for example right when the plane landed and everyone stood up or at the end of class and it was time to go id either sit and pretend to gather my stuff or do the belt cover
you make an excellent point just look at the testosterone levels dropping
have dinner with your kids every night no television or digital devices in their roomsteach them to respect but be wary of authority always hit the bully back hard and quick then tell me about it so i can have your back when i show up to school
great point i think there is a balance there i was raised to respect but be wary of my teachers like dont be left alone in a room with them and speak up when i disagree my parents had my back always and knew what was going on in school because we spoke at the dinner table
now thats a different story a lot of kids getting pushed an agenda and confused at an early age especially sickening when the mother is the one pressuring it
lraise your kids to be able to spot bs and not be swayed easily also i know kids who come out the womb gay pretty sure its genetic
growing up when i was little and listened to the oldies station i assumed this group was black it just felt like there was so much soul and life behind it i feel like that was bad of year old me
goes to show that some police are just concerned with getting a guy to boost their personal ego it has nothing to do with getting the actual guy too important a job to do that
yeah because you shouldnt be packing a pickle go see a doctor or become an adult actor or both
you can tell they mustve absolutely lost it laughing after that line because they cut super quickly to that medium shot
thats like asking seabiscuit to kick you
that hair is totally fake how is that even a question
my wife just lost her mom it was a difficult mothers day that i wrote a little about on my profile keep celebrating their lives by living your life in a manner that they would have bragged to their friends about wishing you well
when did being a mother and homemaker become an insultthe alternative is working for a and boss that sees you as a widget to make the company a profit
its like a freudian slip of the body if you werent gay your bodies wouldnt have accidentally touched
i dont get it either
its insane that the world has put up with this
and in saying this you are primitively ignorant
excellent i wish human parents in public had that kind of control over their yutes
theyre totally jealous of your lack of inhibition
king of curses hmyou dont seem that threatening to me
 you dont seem like the type ive dealt with before
ootthis is why i hate you
guess that happens by becoming a damn pirate
normalize people having great chemistry and being besties at the same time like tbh refusing to believe they arent dating is kind of a dig at their craft
ive been waiting to say this but asking someone to get married when theyre a raising star in their late twenties to someone theyve known less than a year is just insaneeeee to me
nations daughter if were being honest
me when i remember some people are obsessed with men and not women
me and the bad bitch i pulled by being a loser
when they match your freak
that one just made no sense to me pls
why is everyone calling u positive personally i think ur psychic
someone doing this at all is still insane
i refuse to believe this is real
no cus in just about every way just say you only find men attractive in looks and personality and go on your way
are they stupid
why would u word it like that
this hurts to see be warned not for kids
why is that racism
what do we think abt my hsr men who are not men list
just psychic girls who are actually psychotic and should go to therapy
big fan of ships that are serene quiet loving partners but have nyasty disrespectul ass sexy time
i have a confession if you have your age and birthdate in bio theres a  chance that i looked up your birthchart
no fr women know how to control themselves so
people view you as charming and charismatic but u tend to be mor introspective and dont reveal your true self to others except those you feel  comfortable with also youre a hopeless romantic
helpp am i a stalker in your perception
nice nice yea i was obsessed with anything superman growing up
geezsome people have incredibly massive egos
 its a term now used to disparage a game just as you said
lol their air of superiority is laughable
fascinatingive had a lot of chats along the line my wifes blood sugar didnt increase after orange juice but mine went through the roofbut if blood glucose response to identical meals varies as much as to different meals in non diabetics then zoe really is pointless
this scattergun approach to somehow overcome the great harm done to kids seems a mere smokescreen to avoid confronting it adults and children alike lost the habits of good health and many are still lost and cant see a way outa bit of fishing thatll do it
oh that is magnificent farts you feminist appropriator you
same principle i guess its like your best anecdote from studenthood that distorts in the mouth of another and in the end you cant remember whose story is the right one usually the one thats a little less funny
sigh well nobody stares at your boobs tom i hopeconfidence wearing nice clothes makeup and expensive perfume gives you confidence it means you can present hte person you want to be to the world
oh i think thats the saddest thing i ever heard
wrapped in sanctimony and sauced with hypocrisy no please
ugh female hormones overrated glad that phase of life is over tbqhwy
bleurgh i admire vegans i really do but they just dont think about food the same way i do id happily eat a veggie meal vegan if your first thought is vegan not flavour it is very hit and miss
mine hates them too i have a collection of gifts squirrelled away for the few times i am allowed a long soak in the bath
im surrounded by people in their mid s and many are not welli wonder if the risk thats attributed to weight and weight alone is right is this confounded by lighter folk taking more exercise and better nutrition not just less i guess the cohort will tell us in the end
thats why it surprised me and your observation tends to suggest youre the exception
good point i wonder if they filtered out that group
sorry to read it that really doesnt sound at all goodi totally understand the argument for those carrying a morbid amount of excess weight but for those who could change their lot with lifestyle many can surely i guess its difficult to know where that line is
mmmhhmm you can go off people
but its not funny at all
youd be shocked to learn the number of famous people who changed their jewish names to something more white soundingask yourself why why do they want people to think they are white
why are people being shamed for not seeing a movie im so sick of this shit lol this constant push to control what you think and do at all times is so obnoxious
are they even human idk anymore lol
you are pure evil
yeah but you also think boys can be girls and men can get pregnant you arent the ripest apple in the orchard and i feel this is translated into your taste in movies spoiler alert normal people not in your woke cult general dont like woke shit
i wish i had a better vocabulary because fucking hell really doesnt seem to do you justice
i remember going to germany for wacken and being off my tits watching german mtv and not recognising a single thing i was seeing but certain i could understand it all
same with the uk anytime i see a place in here trending its like great what fucking weapon has done something stupid
how they interact with people or tried to engage with them or had just conversations and theyve been so negative or mean its just killed anything about them i could be attracted to
like dont get me wrong im a horny moron and i will at first glance be like fuck shes gorgeous but if i get to speak to people and theyre rotten i couldnt force myself to want them there have been people on here who i thought were literal perfection then ive seen
both are objectively attractive but the whole what men want is so subjective cause to me personally regardless of how attractive they were if they were bad people i couldnt say id be able to find them attractive
yes thats the worst thing isnt it that its on something so cute like i never wanted my stuffed animals to get erections
if that scares you and ive seen you ride things the size of a monster can then it must truly be scary honestly take it out of the sweet stuffed toy and id be less freaked out
it almost seems like youre trying to tell us something
im so unfuckable ive developed a personality so vile that im my own vicious cycle 
thats absolutely trash my love at least your kiddo is feeling better i cant imagine being ill looking after ill is easy
fair point you have to be slightly more evolved than moss to actually think your bullshit through
these people truly think that nobody will fact check anything they say
my last girlfriend kicked my ass at video games so did my sister this is a thing that i must confess
this is not acceptable
youre a gay dude with makeup trying to trigger programmed reflex actions in straight men in nature among insects this would be a form of deceptive predatory behavior

well yeah your issue isnt one of color its whos a thrall of the antichrist thats who needs to be banished
i think its obnoxious but ill endorse it its better than being disarmed gay cat people under the influence of the antichrist
notice theyre recognizing the choice is your utter destruction or theirs lol doesnt matter im purging the whole world you included
if its a group of satanist jews named the saboteans that control most of americas companies and theyre the ones causing inflation aside from that no one likes their landlords unless hes a really cool guy my tenants love me and saved me too how many people can say that
trans people are all insane its memetic conditioning

you only know the mentally ill ones then judging by the flaggots in your profile
at this point i really give two fucks if youre a citizen or not you cant speak english get them the fuck out of here
im still a good person i just do bad things to bad people
if it wasnt so destructive i would almost think its cute how retarded they think we are
by all means im not saying any one of us would ever engage in any behavior like that all im saying is exactly what they said in the donald trump movie that they just to influence thats all it only needs to sway one or two
these fucking weirdos have become intolerable
if such a counter is created to recent man vs bear then i doubt in the intelligence of those people
both are fakewe arent in the first place
my yo father just got diagnosed with autism depression and beginning of alzheimers im devastated

a barbauld fashion a vision in a legacy for young ladies  despotic authority fashions our garb  cramps motions a nightmare in queen of fashions court trussed in tortuous whalebone bullied into conformity via threat of social exclusion rules often arbitrarily changed
domestic violence abusers & stalkers likely to be among men released early as often receive short sentences & most eligible for the scheme serving mths or less not a coincidence these crimes primarily affect women whore routinely ignored & deprioritised by the justice system
i like how those who dance along the lines are harassed but people like myself who are upfront arent even bothered
impliment taunting 
people in general are stupid
sometimes we do
that or ill just make the crucible so toxic others leave
big words i can tell youre an idiot
in my defenseim an introvert i rarely want to go on dates or have sex with anybody anywayi even hate phone calls  everyone ive dated i met purely by chance  either school work or mutual friends
men bully and make fun of single women also men i am so lonely and i cant find a mate and its a f* loneliness crisis the government needs to look into
wanting lovers while simultaneously being insufferable incelsi wonder how well thats going for them
idk about that men who want sex know where to get hookers they are literally everywhere
jack do you know that no man is owed any sexit is this kind of thinking that makes sex feel like a chore to women and thats why there are more dead bedrooms
a self respecting man also should have a bad past 
some men cause the nerotismalways causing chaos to the woman they claim to lovemy absolute least favourite are the men who cheat on their pregnant women
i dont support all women some of you b* are crazy
or they f* niggas because they like to f* niggas and it should not be your problem what two consenting adults got going on
honey i fuck girlsyall better be safe straight people embarrass themselves every time
nohe should be busy being a warrior and not doing that gay stuff
im not looking for any warrior im sorry you have a man who doesnt care about birthdays and holidaysnow you gotta come here and pretend you dont care for such things as well
sometimes you didnt know
i mean the same men say they hate whoresso basically they cant be helped
which is why male loneliness is not womens problem theres nothing we can do for lonely men but pray they find community in their bros
this why i truly dont care about the male loneliness crisis
no one can lead you onthey said what they wanted and you said what you wantedits your choice to stayif you stay thats on you
then we shouldnt be bothered about male loneliness crisisit got nothing to do with us
dont men keep saying they dont want to be friends with us
youre the idiot
sleeping with lesbians has been known to increase your value and also increase your chances of getting an orgasm
wanting to have sex with your friends negates the friendship imo
saying most men in the friendzone would like a relationship is an exaggeration
bullying someone for momentary laugh of yours is no funthe scars left is not a jokeone day youll realise it and youll resent yourself as much as i do
one of them yaps a lot and one of them blabbers a bunch of nothing
tmrw we get polini apologise for the person ill become after i see itmy whole personality is gonna be about it everytime i speak youll hear me talk about it
theres an oomf who sayslets interact more all the time and then ghosts mid convo like its not even two texts if it was a long convo i get it but it wasnt it was hi hi wyd yes and then ghosted really yeshonestly i felt bad
wait i think i think i mistook you for someone else which thing are you talking about
make sure to be really confident in your stand and dont even slightly look like youre losing even if you are if they counter your counter start your statement with what they have said and talk about the negative in it to shut them out
not only concentrating on your points but also concentrating on their mistakes will help you for that if they make a mistake or construct a sentence poorly you can sometimes use that to misinterpret their point and make it sound like they are infact supporting your point
i was always saying that
toxic friendship is the toughest thing just distance yourself little by little if you cant say it directly
people fight over profile pics
why do outlets have to have such cute faces theyre just begging me to stuck my finger in them
the best part of being a weirdo are all the strange interactions you have with fellow weirdos
esp if its related to having sex with someone only bc u havent been with a goth baddie for example my strawberry jammed but my glock didnt
ya but dont worry it curdled inside their stinky ass organs
it turns out that thee are really people who miss people they have never himsustainovative living with apo
stop and tell your friends if you smoke this it will certainly cause harm to your body enough with the jokes its really being pushed

what does that even mean
look at all those idiots with their masks still on
well god willing you continue to do well i think the jabs can be a ticking time bomb for some
damn straight and they dont say talk to your parents in fact this video is aimed and separating children from their parents unfortunately too many parents had their kids get the jab i pray our parents are now educating themselves and questioning

all a japanese sugar baby woman did was take million yen from older men who paid her out of their own will & shes being put in prison for nine years whereas real rapists pedos & women girl abusers dont even get five years when will japan get into that b grind
michu is so real cuz no matter how much someone tells me that a person is so considerate towards everyone id doubt that theyll be the same with me & will always keep looking for my own personal special friend
they are literally each others manic pixie dream girl they inspire motivate & literally drive each other to work
nooo i share that idea & im so happy someone else does too ppl seem so defensive over women in het relationships when that doesnt have to be her end goal only recently did women have a life outside of men & theyre trying to act as if women in love are sooo hated
damn i mostly turn to fiction cuz life is shit and i can imagine a better life for everyone except cis men
anthy & rei = taste automatically btw do you like anyone written by women general question
remove the joke
damn is it wrong to say i just love media where women kill men & stay together especially if theyre sapphic
man hating bisexual
and they seem kinda annoyed by the fact that lesbians are obviously far more oppressed than gay men and hence face lesbian erasure & also have to face patriarchal oppression
sooooooo is that person basically saying that the reason they like gay movies more is because theyre far more diverse & cover a wider range of topics than lesbian movies but also wish the same for newer lesbian movies also how come they never mentioned handmaiden
yeahh i saw it in some chinese insta insight accounts its honestly so sad east asia is so open in its body shaming & weird with womens sizes
because they think women arent capable of making things better than men apparently filmmaking is still far more male dominated than writing
you are a rape apologist
being financially dependent on your rapist is incomparably worse than keeling them and feeling guilty later because of that rapists abuse again
its just insane to me do those people want a gr00med & manipulated victim to stay like that forever 
rapists getting punishment is bad cuz rape victims will just be keeled before evidence gets out plus what would dependant family members do if the rapist is the breadwinner would you rather live with a mentally unstable rapist ur whole life or travel around social orgs
oomf just discovered that media can be good and bad at the same time

and they think youre crazy and i said its a different world we live in
when your dad comes over your house in and says what are you doing and youre sitting at the kitchen table on your computer saying im making more money than bill gates but im not telling you shit

and i fucking hate it here i gave everyone a fucking chance i understood all where they were coming from but none dared to look through my eyes or even into my mind because what they saw was a petrifying vile reflection of themselves and everything in the infinite
speaking of which ive mentioned anpupu multiple times and have yet to see them pop up interesting i guess its because im not blatantly evil idk
its true insidious insanity
and now youre resorting to calling me gay wow so original it seems that youre dry of any valuable deeply thought out counter response or argument please continue with your stale repetitive mediocre responses its too fucking predictable just like your god
no you havent youre being a smart aleck smartass thinking theyre smug and clever i know i cant convince you because you already made up your mind because you care more about your ego than the truth of everything in the infinite eradicate your ego and youll see
i can neither confirm nor deny that some of us sinister enjoyers prefer big booty women and milfs more so but i also can neither confirm nor deny that some of us mostly prefer terror and insanity inducing substances to learn eldritch truths

its hurtful to be criticized for your weight remember your worth isnt measured by your appearance instead of seeking a quick fix like diet pills focus on a balanced diet and enjoyable physical activities

im laughing because i know im talking to a teenager girl you dont know me why do you think she would be jealous of what or who do you think one wants to have a relationship with someone like that what treats you like this no thanks
secondly for you it is wrong for one to talk to a baby that has not yet been born which is true but is it okay to edit photos and upload pornography of a  year old girl not to mention that they want selena to die and using her illness as a mockery and lets not even talk
they always talk about how you shouldnt talk about a baby that hasnt been born yet honey if the baby were with us it would be wrong to talk about a child in the same way they are not to blame for the parents who fathered it
the power that selena has to make people hate that girl hahahaha honey stop lying to you the reason they hate her is because of her own fault and actions no for selena
i have blocked most of themi dont want to see their comments full of hate and envy much less now everything is happiness on this side
the only thing i see is that many like you are crying
fr im tired of seeing how they always try to change everything to make us the bad guys as if they didnt have groups and pages dedicated to speaking badly and inventing fake news about selena
the fact that you call her that trying to sound offensive proves our point and i find it funny that they think it bothers us or offends us when the truth is that we dont care and even more so if it comes from a person who hides behind an account of twitterpathetic
are you making fun of a woman whose desire is to be a mother and due to health problems it is difficult for her then they cry when someone says something about h we should make a thread about all the times they are using this as an attack on sel

diet coke girls bipolar disordersprite girls children root beer girls i like digging holes in the ground
i think there is a negative way to see this as well as a positive way negative unrealistic expectations set up by disney & hollywood create false expectations of what marriage is supposed to be people especially women will conflate whats on the screen with how it should be feel or look like in reality positive more women are less willing to settle for sub par relationships than they once did in the past longevity of a marriage doesnt translate to a healthy marriage eg a woman who is taking care of things at home while her man provides but also sleeps around and has made it clear that he has no intention to changing
great breakdown with practical actionssex is much different in the mind of a woman than it is in the mind of a man learning to understand and harness these differences is the key to a vibrant sex life
contrast the words & presence of these women to the messages men hear from women todaytoxic masculinity men are pigsall men are r*pists stop manspreading mansplainingthe future is femalewe dont need men do betterlet the contrast between these sentiments & attitudes resonate for a little bitfeel itcan you feel what impact this has on the hearts of men
a womans belief in her man is perhaps the most potent fuel source he can receiveyes men also need to feel that their fellow man believes in him as well but it just hits different with a womanit is meant to heres why 
making your woman feel seen is one many men miss
we got it backwards if we think that holding things against ourselves is the way to making better decisions & living life better hating myself for a donut i had yesterday wont make the salad i have tomorrow more healthy   id be eating resentment not nutrients
 especially when the ego seeks uniformity & agreement in black & white ways
i received a tiktok comment from a man on this reelhis comment captures perfectly one of the biggest reasons men struggle to forgive themselves
men some of you are holding onto things that happened years agobeating yourself up over what you did do or didnt do because you didnt know what you now know is a recipe for resentment & sufferinglife is always happening for youeven when you f*ck up
we are living in times where psychological splitting is on full display people struggle to see others as dynamic & whole and instead separate them into good or bad the deeper reflection here is that they are doing the very same to themselves unconsciously
i think there is a negative way to see this as well as a positive waynegative unrealistic expectations set up by disney & hollywood create false expectations of what marriage is supposed to be people especially women will conflate whats on the screen with how it should be feel or look like in realitypositive more women are less willing to settle for sub par relationships than they once did in the past longevity of a marriage doesnt translate to a healthy marriage eg a woman who is taking care of things at home while her man provides but also sleeps around and has made it clear that he has no intention to changing
excellent thread all of these are on point active listening is one that i think is a game changer for kids and adults alike it might seem inefficient especially to a lot of men since we like to be direct and to the point but repeating back what we heard the other person say is extremely valuable it will either let the other person know yes you got it you got what i said or they will say no you didnt get me and there is room to clear up the misunderstanding this already serves to decrease the tension of the arguing because its no longer a focus on trying to defeat the other person but a focus on getting to the crux of what they want you to understand doesnt mean you need to agree
yes acknowledge the mistakes they made and also release resentment held against them or oneself one pitfall ive seen people make myself included is to swear an oath of i will never be like that ill be better this can lead to doing actions out of spite as opposed to genuine love & goodwill eg parents swearing to never be like their authoritarian parents turning into the other extreme of overly permissive parents
as many in the comments have already mentioned a big piece of this seems to be what psychology has termed splittingit starts young peas & carrots cannot touch each other people struggle to see beyond categorization
parents were the first trust the expertsif blind obedience was conditioned then without room for question it should hardly be a surprise why many children grow into adults who obey without question
i see this in ways1 some men havent ever witnessed women in their fiery feral expression in that case this can be a shock making fun of it can be a way to cope with the shock  cathartic processes have grown in popularity this is great for severely repressed emotions however they also do not build deep lasting change similar to people who frequent plant medicines to have a big experience ive seen women and men return to these big cathartic experiences over and over without any meaningful change the depth work & integration simply isnt there but because it is big it is loud and it draws attention people mistake it for being the effective way a womans or mans big emotions & expressions do not always convey the core truth that is actually behind the catharsis
well said to disown ones own power then side eye others standing in their power is to say if i cant have it then you cant either
 especially when the ego seeks uniformity & agreement in black & white ways
there is stubbing your toe and then there is beating yourself up over having stubbed your toe
we are living in times where psychological splitting is on full display people struggle to see others as dynamic & whole and instead separate them into good or bad the deeper reflection here is that they are doing the very same to themselves unconsciously
wait u saying the more u stay with your partner the less the sex drive and at times you do it just for the other personam never getting married theres so much bad vibe about it so far ive had about umshado some shit i cant stand for besides sex
its funny how my gender strips for likes and fame yet they dont put same effort on doing things that would betterthemselvesnoman would want to be told his woman goes like this in the streets but kesisi do u
funny how we all say it just for the benefits and when you finally say it to someone that really makes u mean it that person will hurt u to thecoremanunderestimate the power of a woman to pretend woman are unpredictable
good content but then not all woman are like thatas i always say never choose your partner over your own kids it never ends well
then keep it to yourself my love this is tweeter it aint for the faint hearted unless this reflects to uangan am not your viginal expect thats why i accepted every opinion from others and didnt attack rest theres no need for violence
u honestly cant be blaming men about your hormone secretionwhat do you do as a woman to show you want to be intimate get orgasm be dripping watch what u eat do gym everything
i always say this being a wife or main chick doesnt always mean he loves u at times u not his mate u just someone who can help him build his dreams with and when his done he files for divorce then marry the same side chick or not marry at all
anal sex is more like any other position u do during sexsome of us dont do sex the old way we are adventurous we explore and find new ways of enjoyingsexcallit gay if u want to but i believe being gay its fuckin man not a womans ass
look if u were not so colonised u wouldnt be ashamed to call it gqebhera bcz thats what itits the name from its roots but hey thats how u see it intlekisa photo how i see it its how u see your own roots as intlekisa and giving elizabeth the honors she doesnt deserve
yes its possible to get satisfied sexually but a woman is like a weather u cant predict her bcz how she behaves differs with treatment

thats kind of the idea your body is alerting to you there is a problem in that areaoh wait a sec youre talking metaphorically arent you
you are more than just a little bit of a naturalist arent you
it is an unfortunate side effect of fame its not right at all but it is a fact 
i mean how could anyone ever call jimin at any point fat but they did everyone of them has been suffered hate and ugliness ignorance abounds when such talent and true character is present and oh forbid they are all strikingly handsome on top of that it is so wrong but it is
not all will understand but bh has given them artistic freedom since about or  the clothes became more individualistic make up softer they were changing hairstyles and color like shirts and their own youtube and shows to have self control of the image
they let us see this  bold unabashed truth so we understand they are humans and our judgement hurts they need support and our love and understanding that they have the same feelings as us and they can be hurt by us  we must stop idolizing and treat them like family
blocking bullying humans in the name of humanity the irony  but the saddnes that it invokes is even greater
ok as the noona here we should never possess each other  possession is for inanimate objects not humans and if a person who claims to love you will play the jealousy game they are already out the door and you dont know it yet never degrade yourself by being disrespected
each of us have own processes personally i have no room in my life for jealousy you humiliate me by insulting my intelligence acting a fool with someone else i will surgically cut you out of my life trust gone  your gone simple no time for nonsense
will never be too chill to hate on barbie worse than any stinker cbm by far
if i could have seen oppenheimer on a big screen i would have really had fomo for that one barbie i would have walked out midway and asked for a refund lol
example i read an audiobook about mccarthy for context on the red scare after watching oppenheimer one of the reviews was saying dont worry its not as anti t***p as you might think and my faith in humanity did hit zero that day cant even read something from another pov
that said its healthier to think this way than not even if it is obnoxious better too much ego than too little
and to be fair ive seen this work the opposite way too where protagonist syndrome drives people to bitch about something not being woke enough for them its the inevitable outcome of western exceptionalism ideology everyone can be an astronaut
a lot of times people cry woke because theyve centered themselves in the narrative of a game movie etc creators are the center of the creation but everyone thinks *their* tastes and *only* their tastes should be specifically catered to its more main character complex
so much insane stuff happens on a daily basis that the phrase you cant make this up needs to be retired yes the world is a stage and its now hosting a batshit reality show we get it enough with that stupid cliche already humans can make any crazy stupid thing happen
ashlee simpson trending is such a throwback culture was so different back then everyone was complaining about lip syncing now everyone does it plus auto tune and every other digital trick in the book on almost every song out there the plastic surgery debate ditto wild

jesus christ let the dog come and have a cwtch and hes let the smelliest fucking fart off right under my nose literally taste it at the back of my throat grim as fuck

overthinking is your conscious self overriding your truer sub conscious self we can learn to get out of our own way
the relationship between the sexes is so terrible because no one reads poetry that and careerist incentives for both sides life constantly being denied

work experience has no relation to this considering you can get a job at  17 sometimes as low as  at least in the us
this isnt about oppression you strawman loser
isnt that what you cry misogyny about when a guy has a bad thing happen to him due to a woman and he generalizes women to protect himself and yet hes still labeled a misogynist just say ur a fuckin hypocrite
theyre just tits its just nipples grow the fuck up

even the neighbors most all younger than me are pretty okim not sure how they manage to sound like a pack of elephants going up & down their stairs but ive chosen to find that amusingi call my complex desolation row after the bob dylan song & it adds to its charm
also seems to me that asking anyone to pay attention to every little thing happening in the world & have an emotional response to it its just not reasonable not productiveso its definitely an exhausting way of life
how about a person looking in a mirror
i guess part of where i am on my journey is allowing everyone else to be where they areit does require some self censoring at times but never anything i absolutely need to expressmost of my thoughts dont need expression & doing so amounts to a lack of impulse control
if something that is regular & unoffensive to me causes someone i know discomfort as a result of individual differences if i can ill avoid causing the discomfortvery few things in this world are necessary but id like to try to be kind
people for the most part dont seem to have the energy & or patience to apprehend others lives experiencethis is the root of many misunderstandings injustices & brush offs
here it is i dont know how true any of this is but these ideas are definitely out there
maybe but its mostly a social media excessive interconnectedness thing imopeople should speak their truth & be kind & scroll on when in doubt

fairy gang wins againsnaps her fingers to mute all noises around and proceeds to run away 
  i saw a star once but never the others ye from one side im not surprised no one gives a shit about them but from other theyre also kinda the protagonists of four different spin offs five if you count fairy wars so youd assume at least someone would care enough idk
  of course not im not a nerd actually yes my dad used to watch it before the divorce
usually star plays this something of duty thingy so i guess something scary
you bet star is ominous as ever and sunny is well sunny but fairy gang forever were always gonna be buddies

to reduce jjk to such a black and white type of series is to admit you never actually payed attentionthe whole point is that the protagonists are being ideologically challenged and losing thats not a whiplash thats literally been a thing since shibuyaim you
chapter sets the premise for the seriesthere are giant kaiju that one ninja alone had the power to stopim convinced you people complain for complaing sake
i wonder if we will get to know the other registered special grade curses before the series ends

i think one important detail to not be overlooked and should be noted is that somebody in the atf green lit the whole thing to go down exactly the way it did they planned this whole thing to happen exactly like this whoever it is is no better than a serial killer
no thats actually stephen colberts content for his show its a horror show and his studio audience still wears masks
resident evil movies and games were the violent failure of secret powers that were using medical powers to recover people hiding underground from all the wars even punic
this tv series for qualified realities   with some understanding of the matter you are safer and perhaps even healthier it was real all the shows films and music selections are history document with agency level intelligence work
darkness felle is one of my future anime movies you can make the game and pre release for alpha dev if youd like contact medical and id like some assurances not money i think

the handmaidens main plotline was literally adapted from a book written by a lesbian & co written by a female screenwriter goddd your tweet proved nothing but how films made by women & queer women dont get as much appreciation as ones made by men do

your reply implied l liked the movie bcoz of the book when many people knew of it from the movie both are different mediums  the male director controls everything thats simply not true sapphics are comfy once they knew women worked on it which i get to an extent
the movie is loved is cuz it presented its themes & their subversion masterfully which wouldnt be possible without womens input hell the film wouldnt exist if not for fingersmith also pcw made feminist movies before like lady vengeance with the same female co writer
its alr hard to find proper rep of darker themes & lesbian intimacy without it being fetishism sometimes theyre even discouraged thai gl dramas recieve hate i get why some sapphics are uncomfortable with this movie but there was surely a lot of female creative input in them
handmaiden was adapted from a book written by a woman & the film was also co written by a woman named jeong seo kyeong the movie handled themes of lesbian sexuality & liberation very well & the actresses felt comfortable too idk why yall are upset the director was male
where are u reading it omg
i think they meant handmaiden vs portrait but still handmaiden is astronomically better im sorry media where women kill men & stay together
can u explain co prison of lesbian & gay movies regarding what
people forget that a lot of the content in the film must be written & practically executed the director is the main force because they put it l together but they arent the only force
i felt like handmaiden was better than portrait but both are really amazing movies

i agree the flaws of breaking bad are more prevalent and the characters actions particularly walts are more confusing still breaking bad is a top show for me but the sopranos is in a different league
yes thats correct but uncle junior tells tony that he thought tony could have made the pros in episode  its so entertaining to see the characters always lying to each other
great line i believe this was in episode pax soprana
the godfather part ii
absolutely such amazing acting talent in the series
the real question is which band did you dislike more
these two series are in their own league for me its the sopranos but the wire is the only show i can live with if someone says its better
both are amazing i used to think for many years but recently started enjoying more i have a soft spot for the immigrant story of young vito and how this runs parallel to michaels fall in america is also more complicated so i get more out of it in each rewatch
theyre all great but season takes the cake for me
so many great quotes but the one you mentioned sums the whole series up such a sad poignant momentenjoy the remaining episodes
i agree the happy wanderer is one of my favorite episodes
haha now you know what we go through every week hopefully as josh watches others who havent seen the show will start to watch too
i agree the perfect end to the episode that changed tv forever
two excellent tv characters who never seemed to learn from their mistakes
such an amazing scene so much is said between tony and chris without them actually saying it
one of my favorite scenes so much is being said between tony and chris here without either of them actually saying it

i love it
theyll be coming online in the next few weeks ^^
fantastici have a close relative who fits this description to a t
you spoke the word straight out of my head this is their careers we are the fans as such it is up to us to choose to support whatever path they lead us  and i will love my muses till my dying breath im years old so who knows when that will be but im all in  all in
since this year i watched feud capote vs the swans i rewatched the movie capote the show is brilliant dont know why its barely mentioned at all and the movie is a masterpiece been a long time since i last watched it
i know comparisons are lazy but it really felt like alice in wonderland meets frankenstein but completely original the oddball aesthetics the satire of the romantic eras fiction the usage of color and b&w i loved it
poor things is also on hulu oh my god id heard a lot about it but what a movie deserving of every accolade cinema cant be doing *that* badly if such a bizarre and beautiful film made it incredible
yeah that was a really good movie driver and cruz were powerhouses in different ways great dynamic between them wild that this went down in my dad was born that year
beer break im digging ferrari so far penelope cruzs performance is my favorite the opera sequence highlighting the memories of grief then immediately jumping to the brash mechanical roar of the carsthat was good film
i forgot in my bitching about mediocre content that fallout was a recent streaming show that was great so theres still hope for streamers beyond being just content im going to rewatch it sometime soon even more of this please
then again it takes a lot to affect me i thought parasite the movie not the show with the y was a dark comedy and was surprised when everyone said it was a drama and they were all emotional over it it cracked me up still does
but nothing deep and affecting i dont think i remember the last streaming anything that was genuinely moving i guess it really is more content than anything else i still watch though too much time on my hands
come to think about it there hasnt been much streaming either i got drunk and had some laughs with road house i did enjoy dead boy detectives which randomly had a fujoshi character never thought id see that in the mainstream even if they didnt use the term
all the big movies this year are from franchises i could take or leave im pretty much over the mcu except holding out slight hope for d&w sometimes i regret not being able to go to theaters but not this year so far
one reason for this may be the availability of game viewing if im interested in a games story but its too stupidly difficult i watch it over on youtube and theres twitch too for those that like commentary i do not
we have a dog named dexter after the show the joke is i didnt name him that he was named by another fan of the show one of those weird coincidences
the books were darker colder than the show so im just wondering if itll lean into that more or go with the balanced vibe of the shows early best seasons both are great
i wonder if the new dexter show will go darker or lighter he did kill neighborhood pets
theyre not mentioned much but veronica and sister death hit the mark of great horror for me hope theres another movie
when you saw that tv on a cart with the vcr below that was going to be a peak day at school
thriller trending reminds me of that one time a teacher not only wheeled in the tv+vcr combo of coolness but set it to play the thriller music video it was near halloween time and it was awesome
i have a huge mp3 collection of game soundtracks that goes back to when i imported the suikoden and wild arms cds then ripped them to mp3 on my sony vaio those were the best times
music is another big part of videogames thats rarely mentioned many of my favorite soundtracks have been from games ever since ecco the dolphin secret of mana ffvi and columns my peers were listening to actual hits and i was ok with them but also had my nerd beats lol
i thought the first silent hill movie did a good job of portraying cheryl alessas pain it was a very female oriented horror movie without being exploitative yes pyramid head was there and he shouldnt have been i know but i liked it the second movie ugh
for all the bazillion silent hill pt clone games out there not one has leaned into the dark suburban horror and everyday insidious threat of domestic violence escalation that the radio voice portrayed its always just creepy woman stalking you
i heard once they were working on a beauty show and no you cant do it its impossible especially today when kink is more demonized than ever and the books were not big on consent sexual fantasy does not translate well to modern audiences especially s&m
i read anne rices beauty series back when so all the fifty shades were pale compared to that that series was yeah even my fanfic doesnt come close to the beauty books and i go dark sometimes those stories were wild as hell
this also happens to be barbas first episode too lol my favorite ada
this old svu episode is referencing fifty shades lol i couldnt get through that book not the kink just how poorly written it was and i read all of twilight that was ya fluff horror light fifty shades was trying so hard to be hard without being hard corny
kubricks range is incredible dr strangelove is still my favorite dark comedy political satire compare to the shining  a clockwork orange full metal jacket etc dark themes in all but each one was its own experience entirely
masterful movie every single aspect was perfect from the slow build of tension into pure horror to the chillingly isolated atmosphere and the gorgeously unique visuals off putting but also appealing in a weird way one of my all time favorites
not a trend asking which dead celebrities fans would bring back if anything thrives on social media its paradoxes and poor taste probably an info grab for the inevitable celebrity resurrections via ai generation
that story is so cursed i had an excellent sequel i was working on once but i lost all of it and ive never found a copy i usually copy everything but nope its one of my favorite older stories too weird
its not just politics over personalization that annoys me btw its not the artists fault per say but the constant lyrics deciphering and tabloid gossip style hype over a certain recent album was so off putting to me like i just want to enjoy the music damn
that was a beautiful finale a great run i will miss it but the end was perfect laughs tears everything doctor shaun murphy will always be one of my favorite characters
moon knight was a great show and i will not hear anything else we were robbed of more seasons robbed
not looking forward to muting everything hotd for a month until the whole season has aired because im not paying max for one show until the whole thing is available bright side is that the final episode airs on august  so its gonna be a birthday binge for me
watching the latest episodes of the good doctor im really going to miss this show since freddie highmore starred in bates motel before this ive been watching him on tv since lol
i rate every svu episode with a faith in humanity meter in my head kids drop it to zero babies end up in the negative numbers
though with svu only the veneer changes crimes like this never change and the law doesnt change either dark as that show is most cases make me laugh when they try to make a positive spin there are never positive endings in real life and the law is a joke
this teacher on an old svu episode blamed tween girls losing innocence on the kardashians and lady gaga lol what a throwback ive been rewatching the show as background viewing while i finish this story i like procedurals that have run since forever theyre like time capsules
is the ffxvi ultimania ever going to be translated into an english edition i want that so bad
was going through some ffxvi clips for story reference and what the hell was sleipnirs problem with kupka anyway the cliff scene he went off on him barnabas starts preaching about god and sleipnir still just goes on insulting kupka lol i wish ffxvi had a script book
i personally dont care if people enjoy a character because theyre good looking male or female i spent last fall admiring clives handsomeness in ff16 and ive kind of fallen in love with barnabas and sleipnir who am i to judge
there werent many girl gamers back then so the noise wasnt as loud as it is today however my mom absolutely hated lara and tifa lol she didnt let my dad play those games wasnt a fan of claire redfield or jills re3 outfit either she was the jealous type
that theyve gotten this far with a continuous universe spread across mediums since iron man all the way back in is quite a feat this is a good choice to try and bring new young audiences in sounds like therell still be continuing threads for us old fans to follow too
going by that someday people wont believe this era ever complained about ai generated songs and digitally enhanced completely digital superstars where things go from there i cant even imagine ill be dust by then so it doesnt matter to me lol
its been a fun ride i love these movies they were a bright spot during a bad time for me i own two copies of the first two because i wanted the steelbooks when they went on sale lol
are they on netflixor

oocxn  6iiomg thank you so much sweetheart  yeah i love chaotic accounts who only brings laughs to the verse 
oocxn  6iithere are things way too different from the books and more shondas style
oocxn  6iidont get me wrong  i love the bridgerton series but sometimes i wish they could stick to the books sometimes like edwina accepting her big sister marrying anthony and not a love triangle or penelope and eloises friendship little things

bruhl take you wouldnt have the new franchise without the originals you wouldnt have los without jreput some respect on it luis
not you or anyone comedy podcasting is all the same format save a couple that stand out by being slightly different the last i genuinely enjoyed was joey and lees the church
huh you went so far as to blacklist this man from ny comedy just for this one forgivable moment thats bitch shit dude anti cancel culture my culo its a comedy show luis what did you expect the fragile rattlesnake
just not interested in this show anymore i think some shows have run their course and arent meant to be around forever just like nadav so reduce the amount of episodes this show gets make it behind a paywall eat ass on it or hang it up to dry for a few moons
lmfao clever dude i see what you did there the more the austin comedy business model stands out and the more i see unfunny people become famous comedians the more i yawn
a survivable living where in la while shane has freshly bleached hair and a sleek red jacket i just think its poor marketing choice for them rn maybe left buzzfeed too soonidk all the deets about that
i forgot they removed the scene i loved the first season i remember how much it ducked to watch
watching pixar movies always reaffirms my faith in fatherhood whether its andys bond with woody in toy story or the adventurous spirit of carl in up they show that love knows no bounds
according to the disney family theory elsa and rapunzel are cousins notice how rapunzel and flynn make a cameo at elsas coronation in frozen coincidence we think not
who else has tried to sing like ariel in the shower and ended up sounding more like sebastian
today we bid farewell to combat carl the fearless action figure who stole our hearts in toy story lets celebrate his legacy and the adventures he shared with woody and the gang
started with princess dreams ended up with yzma sass lifes funny like that isnt it embracing the villainous chic with a touch of childhood sparkle
lets shake up the princess paradigm how about we rebrand it to disney heroines and celebrate a diverse array of characters like alice lilo and mirabel alongside the iconic mulan time to redefine what it means to be a disney leading lady
total missed opportunity disney really shouldve put that a on ariels brush too right
calling all disney fans quick question does cobra bubbles swoop in before or after stitch finds his forever home with lilo share your thoughts
just watched wreck it ralph break the internet  and now im convinced every problem in life can be solved with a disney princess intervention wheres my squad of singing sidekicks when i need them
can we just talk about how wendys got me in tears and peters being an absolute cinnamon roll and dont even get me started on eugene take me back to disney as an adult pronto
imagine if disney princesses aged with their movies rayas just a newborn while belle from beauty and the beast is hitting the big  0 this year
did you know the frying pan has a higher kill count than all other weapons combined who wouldve thought our kitchen buddy could be so lethal forget swords guns and magic wands disneys rapunzel knows where its at
get ready to surf the waves of nostalgia disneys live action remake of lilo & stitch has just unveiled its main cast bringing our favorite alien ohana to life in a whole new way cant wait to see this iconic duo hit the big screen
love jack sparrow count me in who else has a crew of insanity infused crazy friends like him lets sail the seas of adventure together 
the last piece is coming soon~
are the coolest for sing for the kids in boston your give is noticed 
when is young miami going to jail her rap music she put out says bold she makes females do as she want by force if need be she sounds like your maxwell wanna be  o dont forget diddys best friend is a predator  ankelmonitor  lockeryone up
billie ellishs album is the saddest and most broken love story i have ever heard threw music the tragic love that all red flags scream run for sure where are songs less depressing i hope when i find love its just natural no corks or weird waiting fks that lol
so when drake and kendrick die what are all if you gonna do in the rap industry use this clip of the beat start ur new album 
now the rest of the entertainment industry needs to be good and see what all the fame and money can lead to a path of ugly living i dont feel anyone will ever want to work with any of the artist named on the diddy case sadly i feel its going to take a miracle to save music
marvin gay dead remember slim shady is dead we get to meet marshall mathers now who ever that is at this point
now when do the feds and homeland pick up the rest of the people on the tapes they have unfortunately so many people that have been predators and hurting both young females shipped from detroit and flown out of the country young men  seems alot of people will be arrested
all of billie ellishes new album
great film one of my favorite truly
please save music something funny would be great just asking thanks in advance
how would we know juice world is dead if people are obviously profiting off of his music i hear a remix of his stuff daily as well his work is over used by secondary rappers who really just took advantage of both mac and juices work pay his people  care for macs mamma

literally cant wait to watch this movie
what tyomt is such a special book this is beyond awesome news
just posting this because feud season may forever be one of my favorite series and i miss susan & jessica together on screen
jessica lange with her daughters shura and hannah at the opening night after party for motherplay
does anybody know when places please might get released ive seen they re named it the great lillian hall on imdb recently im quite excited for this movie actually
one of my dreams for the oscars is jessica lange somehow somewhere meeting emma thompson and having them photgraphed together
re watching feud with jessica lange & susan sarandon once again this weekend
so ready for the& jessica lange as a presenter
its didions autobiographical story of the time when she lost her husband & daughter in the same year im pretty sure jessica will play the lead as there is no other female character in that story if so that will be a performance were getting so spoild
omg thank you for this i cant go to nyc so im living for glimpses of the play like this haha
i totally agree i heard that jessicas character might deal with dementia but thats only a rumor the cast sounds so great too
i personally love the nd fleet master sad that we never got that majestic beard as a cosmeticrise however although i didnt like it that much it did characters so well galleus is definitely my favorite with its regal looks and gentlemans posture but the guildmarm tho
definitely lorelei that last one was amazing and she barely gets love from any artist
that arbok is pretty interesting i like it that ekans though thats a rough one mind you im seeing them as if they were made by gamefreak and the current artstyle
pokemon if gamefreak still made it like they made earlier gens now all they make is goofy looking characters and weird pokemon
love the changes coming so far but i didnt see anything about changing appearance or a full character edit its something people really want
the are stupid theyre street performers out all the rich history they chose the lamest concept i chose skeledirge because it at least looks like a pokemon the other two look like a furrys wet dream especially quaxyls that this is an abomination worst starter ever
will this fix the music in expeditions im tired of doing barnacles and blackpowder while jamming to my house themei bet the expedition has some good music but i cant listen to it
next installment yes but successor not even close
exactly just unfollow them its so easy i genuinely believe people like this gets excited when new world posts something and get all giddy writing dead game
oh boy zombies  i wonder if they will also be playing with cheats
there was no problem with mhws monsters namielle alone is an example of how unique monsters were in mhw problem with mhw was the monster variety it was one beast on dlc and all other monsters were wyverns or dragonsbone and iron weapons were crap but the others were great
has to be both tri and iceborne after that then anything over rise it makes certain monsters look like garbage
please just ex all of them theyre not free and theyre not that great anyways you also make more people happy because they can ex their favorite pairs if theyre any gardenia and cheryl fans around then theyre disappointed

to nie chodzi o uprzedzenie tylko pragmatycznie podejcie do tematu obrony stany wydaj na zbrojenia razy tyle co reszta krajw nato i broni swoich interesw niemcy maj armi teoretyczn i olali ostatnie lata zupenie jednoczenie lobbuj by przewodzi cho s w ciemnejd

right when are they going to figure this out we employ a president we arent a fan club or a cult
lmfao no mike not everyone that is patently against your bowel movement from hell is a paid agitator you continue to make excuses for the unpopularity of trump your deplorable policies and your lack of vision and platform to your own peril by all means keep it up
yes thats the difference between us how many different ways does this need to be saidno appearance of a conflict period
project  folks i suggest you read it because this is whats coming when they regain the wh doesnt matter if its trump hes just the goon of the moment
if you read what hes actually saying they want the freedom to own women as they did to n the past that includes their murder
roflmao you have no idea what communism even is your ilk cant decide communism from marxism from socialism every day its something differentmoving on now weve reached the end of magas greatest hits
trump is nurturing the next insurrection or continuance of the first imho
those are your delusions it most certainly was violent and by your own words it was an uprising enough of the crazy we saw it all of us stop it
so they contradict their own narrative that america is disappearingwhy do dems continue to hand them the narrative to lie unchallenged commercials after commercial and interview after interview should be driving shit like this home
one of these days you will figure out democrats dont worship a president no concerts no pep rallies no foolishness they elect him he is not a messiah hes an employee not sure what its going to take to make this penetrate
local elections are not under your purview that is why they voted no as usual youre providing half assed information as for federal elections non citizens are not now nor have they ever been eligible at any time in this countrys history read the constitution
yet its fine taking on the tax burden for big business and billionaires or paying to keep companies open during the pandemic you helped create this mess w predatory interest rates yet to pretend not to know how it happened none of you address this in good faith not one
it will do the exact opposite but you have to understand basic economics first that to penetrate
i cant even tell you im surprised anymorewhat i can tell you is that these people are so terrified and so primitive they n their thinking they are a fundamental threat to american life as we know iti have no intention of living in  a life from the fucking s none
which policies halfwit and be specific the policies that gave us the highest production weve seen in years
video to back up your statement me  donald
ive said it myself since i left the gop before obamas second term dems get punched repeatedly and never speak up decorum only works when both sides play by the same rules they havent been for decades
ive been in healthcare for years it goes without saying we have one as welli should not be held to a higher standard than a judge that makes decisions that impact every single one of us
and just like the american flag you have perverted it for your own virtue signaling he is a professional he knew what he was doing brick by brick the wall has been built this court is compromised
its way too late for that she tossed her voters off a cliff they wont forget that on the other side she challenged the messiah that betrayal wont be forgiven eithershes about as electable as pence her career is over in the end she did it to herself for nothing
yes who from all publicly available evidence broke the law ways from sundayyou had no issue when it was a hillary under investigation foaming at the mouth for punishment evidence didnt provide but no issue rule of law mattered then all of a sudden now victimplz
lol right does that include democratic senators and the presidents songive me a break
they believe in democracy and right now republicans have forced voters to choose the most basic fundamental we have to continue to exist as we have for over years policy which most people cant decipher from procedure takes a back seat to basic existence

because you have nothing to lose when youngi can easily see myself doing way worse in my early s many people are prepared to literally die over an ambition perhaps you are right and he had a financial cushion somewhere but society needs those unreasonable idiots
a good fraction of the responsibility relies on foreigners always believing anything negative they see about america on the internet and lining problematic journalists pockets we had a several year movement spreading awareness of fake news and they still want the rage bait
those are our scholars actually

new yorks government needs to be completely disbarred
what ever happened to the laws of another country do not cross the borders into my country it seems like all the eu does is dictate what laws they want to make a government follow like its some cheap cookie cutter
i hate the idea of any european government official being considered far right because theyre always leftists
how many tax dollars were wasted on having some blue hair fbi agent reading posts that offend them because thats how this list was likely made its just talking on the internet that is getting people placed on the terror watch list
this is your opportunity to negotiate policies with him please take what you can taking incremental steps to get in the right direction is better than the current path
they must antagonize gun owners as much as possible if theyre to stay in line with their ideology the way they do that is to completely reject the idea of anyone being good if theyre a gun owner so roger fortson is evil according to them simply because he owned a gun
i did not say north carolina or a special carve outs to give full immunity im saying in the us delta operators have authority to ensure operational security by any means thats not the same as allowing them to murder anyone they feel like for any reason
this is going to be used as an excuse to nullify the bill of rights under the guise of addressing a national security threat because how do you go after terrorists if theyre american citizens with constitutional rights that protect them
if you take pictures of his wife and kids with intent to distribute to adversarial nations and hostile entities that is considered a compromise unit guys arent fans of having their pictures being taken
china is just using this as a scare tactic theyre not actually capable of force on force direct action
mass invasionamnestynational security threatrevocation and nullification of civil liberties to address national security threatbig government with unlimited power guys this is the gameplan that politicians are playing right now everyone needs to wake up
the craziest thing is we have politicians who want to grant blanket amnesty to millions of people who they dont even know about which would make any sort of measure taken in the interest of national security more difficult unless we trashed the constitution completely
i believe delta force operators get a little more personal discretion technically theyre always in uniform because they often have to blend into civilian environments for most operations attempting to compromise them is generally not a good idea
no thanks im not going to be shot for being a white man with food in a nation going through famine
even if you exclude the factor of racially motivated genocide what do you think will happen when youre one of the few farmers who does go to zimbabwe and the local populations see you with food theyll tear you apart for every last crumb until you have nothing for yourself
delta force has authority to kill anyone who risks compromising national security taking pictures of an operators family so they can be used for ransom is considered compromising national security dont act like you know something when you dont
doesnt delta have authority to kill in the us if it compromises national security because im pretty sure photographing family members of an operator does compromise national security when that information can be used for ransom against any unit guy
every day im reminded of how reagan used the constitution like toilet paper when it came to gun ownership

just baffled why we didnt hear all this before now anyway its great to know that he prioritize us thats the spirit we want
i did not go there but i like them too though they wd not fight for me like jeremy corbyn only jesus is truly perfect but we expect a good standard of justice in an old judeo christian nation
bet the pm is your tory cousin 
will try in very near future also but life under some racism & mean blk hatred made things somewhat harsh but usas trump economy has been helping some  had a better life with the brits who valued education above race but still thankful true
 there r many more now with jc leaving u might just decide to make the chief tory blonde your hero  cant believe the election is really over & it is a rd tory victory yet so much suffering life
 i love corbyn too but it is not like labour missed k jewish votes because of as accusations that caused the elexn loss correct why did u & other diehards not inform the importance of leave votes leave vote errors seemed to be the cause of the loss over murdoch etc
very inspiring mp burgon a lot of us are feeling disappointed
why was it not free & fair i really thot so at first then i saw that labour did not realize leave voters were crucial just as in the cllrs &euro parl elexns shd not all is been dotted & ts crossed before forcing pv & ignoring voters super tough loss for the hurting
my friend trump has done you nothing & your dislike of him is sadly like borderline nazi like hate he has helped a lot of hurting ppl not his fault for being born rich & white any more than you being born jewish million americans of all races aint silly 
damian since you know your country you shd have told mr& others wow i feel it for the homeless & hurting but it will be ok & the sadness of not having a lab govt for so long will hopefully go away soon life & almighty god
is this for real these must be the visitors since no one gets a house sold in + days or a lease settled no citizens leave their country so fast right & others seem to feel similar fear from left so everyone has to try to reach out in respect & not take a know all stance
so tom y with your studies did you not see the leave dismissal wd be catastrophic  we r all trying to get rid of shock & heart pain
nice words mp mean streak &ugly hon hope one of your sons become pm one dayjeremy corbyn for nobel peace prize
true that the media wigs etc were wth the pm but lab had momentum & a chance but strangely missed with the leavers corbyns bible fans r sad but think it is a tough god thing the way things unfold from pmmay borisoct ge tory landslide maybe of jcs sons will be pm
evil of one sort or otherhas always been in our worldu know that fr torah we who love equality & non racism r saddened by this loss yet all the lab mps in leave shd have known the state of brexit does not seem like the election was tory rich wigs manipulation yet sad
hoping boris will have a heart better than the previous pm also good labour ppl will set up funds to help the homeless etc blessings always mp
we know lady diane  even fr way here in usa ppl thot the brexit vote cd be a wedge so it is sad lab lost hard to voice but all labour shd have detected this not just jc wes streeting femi & sam gymiah r something else do not know why hacker muted u on my phone
nice words i have no vote & live in the usafr comm but tweeted once about the brexit voters from  since we saw results in smaller elections sad bec we longed for a lab govt to help the hurting ppl & jc as pm though i liked the new pm from when he was mayor 
we are sad everywhere that we have missed a labour govt for the people hope jc can at least get nominated for a nobel peace prize for his work over the years maybe with john mcdonnell too  blessings always
leave & tories voted for him & he now has a majority he shd be better than pm may in many ways ppl must pray for him still cannot get it that all the labour ldrs & mbrs did not c the opposition of ignoring million brexit voters it was not just jc pushing pv did it
hi lowkey how about a new rap for jeremy corbyn getting a nobel peace prize for fighting for marginalized ppl &justice for over yrs
the fact its outside ncr control completely also allows for the bos to have a presence as fallout style secret society operatives  and the chinese culture and triad presence allows for lots of other secret societies have a tongmeihui type group triads that kinda deal
its not happening because bethesda are morons and theyd fuck it up real severe but san francisco under shi administration with you playing an outsider who doesnt speak the language with a plot based around industrial espionage
this of course follows general trends in us labor strategy to use the criminal justice system to discipline and regulate labor once its implemented expect the cops to start finding the same bag of coke on five people a week
now that ukraine a civilized western nation tm is adopting the russian prisoner recruitment strategy expect it to spread to the us if theres ever severe enough manpower problems the us has million incarcerated people and recruiting even  of that figure would be huge
obviously an unpopular move everybody will hate but expect the british ruling class to veer more into militarism as american power declines and europe destabilizes ukraine has them spooked i think
its a dystopian yet pragmatic move assuming penal battalion loyalty can be maintained its especially useful since you can throw the penal battalions into the meat grinder to save your volunteer troops
doesnt matter  starmer will come out with a watered down version of the same policy thats how these things go the tories propose an extreme policy everybody joins the army and then labour implements a moderate version only boys join the army
to resolve the dilemma between our need to manage stable population figures and our need to do so in a way that isnt insanely hitlerite i have a modest proposal  the government will produce clones of tupac shakur per annum
honestly it makes sense given the uss role in suppressing serb nationalism and being the current guarantor of balkan stability its the one region i think the decline of american power will leave worse off and without real liberatory alternatives to violent ethnonationalism
this is me but for communism
there are other means if you were to give in to them or so i have heard

ok so do you think the democrats are unofficially using meghan and harry for their african agenda hence why gavin was quick to defend and why nancy pelosi orchestrates online smear campaigns against catherine why joe wont hand over harrys visa information
this why m&h fail they have to spread disinformation and plant speculation propaganda to raise themselves up which is debunked by real life

more talking about a minorityto be honest im not really sure what happens in  but i know there are many rallies with national flags lately i think theyre tired probably of the immigration but maybe some other stuffbut to be honest most europe isnt in good shape

i know many people hear this and its awful but its better to look at the bigger pictureiran wasnt a democracy in the time of the shah but it is much better than todays democracy which is fake cause the elections are riggedtoday theyd take the shah

this is not uk if your country had some brain it wouldnt let extremists take over

all those young people claim exaggerated expenses like tories do
i am old enough to remember when tories tried to force unemployed people to do mandatory jobs in a voluntary sector and they ended up working for free in pound land
most british people dont want to work in social care whos going to look after the old and vulnerable now
your government tried to force unemployed people to do voluntary work you had many programmes over the years and all of them failed this is going to be another failure
tories know that young people are not going to vote for them so it costs them nothing to insult the young generation
the bodies are frozen forever the napalise government is greedy and doesnt clean up the rubbish they need to change how they run things
not just expensive you are risking  6 peoples lives also some people dont want their bodies to be moved

the british schools buildings are in a terrible state but the pm and his wife support and donated millions to privileged a private college in california we know his priorities
bezos is part of the problem not a solution
i hope the people of islington will stand by jeremy corbyn
this is a misleading title they are going to excavate the remains these people just dont want the houses in their neighborhood they just want to protect their own investments
thank you for speaking out senator
we would be in jail for much lesser offence than that
americans dont be fooled this is his election trick

day  365 since the nigerian constitution albeit flawed was buried totally and this is the only dish on the menu for apctinubu you have failed woefully theres no single thing to point to that youve done yet you expect me to applaud you
all we did was ask people to vote rightanybody who wishes death on peter obi will go before him
this is the distraction for the weeknotedit wont change the fact that tinubu is a thorough failure and has taken nigeria back to the stone age
all of you connected to this tyrant have blood on your handsyou have murdred sleep get ready to arrest more people
is it really a dumping ground or these corrupt government officials go to their scrapyard to buy repaint and present them as newthey went to get hst intercity that have been withdrawn in britain and they launched as metro whatever in lagos
err not his point isnt so youll feel painedif we want a new nigeria we should share accurate factstrue he gave you a range but if he now gave you the exact fate nothing stops you from admitting you were wrongi cant tell people who to drag but drag with real facts
which of his followersrooting for a candidate who isnt corrupt and can give us at least a decent government is equivalent to his followers giving the impression of a messiahdo you know what you are saying
i mentioned that it happened in kenya not nigeria but because of the thirst for attention they wont take down a false post even when you call them outtomorrow theyll say they want a better nigeria
they are still asking for proof
why arent government officials at the landing sites handing down fines to the boat captains and the rnli as an entity in exactly the same way they do to lorry drivers2k for each one isnt iteasy money and it would soon stop
oh wait maybe this has some baring on why youre not bothering eh nigel youve stood for the uk parliament unsuccessfully seven times havent younow it makes sense
and youre doing what to make things better exactly youre good at talking the talk but thats all it is with you isnt itif your dick was as big as your mouth youd have gone all in with reform long before now to make a differencebut no youre too much of a coward
that wouldnt do much harm to some of the little gobshitessome of them think theyre big & hard just like the bloke who taxed your phonehaving said that maybe youd benefit from a bit of national service toothen maybe youll be in a better position to defend yourself
its nice to see that it is not just britain that has brain dead clueless arseholes as politicians
what bloody planet are you onhe was a violent drug fuelled criminal who once held a firearm against a pregnant woman and you as a mother & grandmother want him honouredand here was me thinking that only british politicians were as thick as pigshit
are you serioussignificant funds for essential public services have been lost due to shortcomings in the welsh governments accountingnhs wales is on the bones of its arse under the watch of you clowns
youre supposed to be a seasoned journalist and you were taken in by a politician going back on his wordreallyshouldnt even be a schoolboy error for someone like you piersy boyyouve been turned over big boy
dont hold your breath piers hell welch on the bet citing that one has voluntarily as well to boot with k of taxpayers money in his back pocketspending grand to save one and we think labour is the problemas much as i hate to say it its laughable at best
to be frank neither do i as usual talking through his arsethe possibility of a general election has been looming for months hes had all that time to formulate a plan of attack but chose to sit back and do nothing with that timehes full of bs
ben habib has been on saying that he is unaware of nigel farages plans to assist the party and as he has a senior position with reform he should know what he is talking aboutso it makes me wonder about farage to me hes proving himself as a self serving bullshitter imo
yes and in at least in two areas where you have authority to kick arse to bring those in authority to bookwhat were you and are doing about kids being groomed and raped in oldham and rochdale again meathead
fuck off you brain dead buffoonits the illegals the rnli are bringing in by the boat load who go on to violently mug people groom & rape our kids and so on that youre doing fuck all about that bothers usthe sooner youre out on your arse the better youre useless
well maybe if they just got on with it without all the usual brouhaha and shut the fuck up about it we might
vote for you not a chance in hell
shouldnt matter let them build to the reveal im sure they have a plan for it
banning things simply because you dont like them is tyranny stop trying to legislate grown peoples choices laws should not be made unless theyre completely necessary the amount of so called p who talk this kinda of shit are also the first to claim theyve lost their own freedoms the coin has two sides everyone if you want freedom then you must allow for others to have it as well regardless of if they believe the same things that you do its really not that hard to understand
who are we today
no but society needs to become the mob and turn the torched group headed to different places where the orders are being given
same with canada
george bush was guilty of
bias for payouts and left brainwashed
trudeau should just get out of canada
they have trust issue
i agree with you on pretty much everything you said public schools are unreliable we choose catholic schools but are not opposed to homeschooling im just not a fan of his reasoning for homeschooling the gender stuff definitely is confusing the kids and has no place in our schools as for homosexuality some of my closest friends are gay one in particular was raised very conservatively and was so ashamed by it that he waited til his parents died to come out
if that father didnt turn up alive we surely would have lost another life needlessly to the greatly flawed justice system the use of eye witnesses has been proven along with admissions of guilt from tort*re are unreliable
they do have the right to an attorney but it seems like that is glossed over as quickly as possible so that the prisoner might forget
san francisco is pretty much its own country within the country of california

particularly when as soon as nhs capacity opens up again the work will disappearwe are busy enough with people who choose our service over others and even outside the services offered by their insurer
of course the private sector has sprung into action to provide a service that creates a profit but this isnt the same service others receive in the private sector and when these patients go back into the public system nhs clinicians cast us all in the same mould
ive looked at pitching for nhs work and always decided it wasnt worth it the pay offered only covered costs so just added risk and all the strings mostly admin attached no taprivate hospitals boss says theyre not the answer to nhs crisisthetimescouk article 9e408
absolutely his stuff on depression hit home too whatever one thinks of peoples politics those who actually gave an eff about others and those who did not showed themselves pretty clearly him and charles walker will always be legends in my eyes
yeah i mean it is a good idea for their wellbeing but is it something our state should be socially prescribing or are there more pressing priorities for our kidsalso depends on the kid if theyre not well it could make them worse
its such a this country needs pulling up by the bootstraps type mentality with absolutely no understanding of how shit life is for the young just disgusting tbqhwy
sure but that would mean that those who are more ill are even more ill if the data are averaged some will be better off but the majority are not
because that was the choice all those bleating about years of the tories forget that the labour party gave us corbyn twice
and labour party wanted more for longer our finances would have been in an even worse state worse cost of living issues can you imagine if corbyn had been in charge business is evil whilst encouraging the leeching of our national wealth to amazon who pay bugger all in tax
i was wondering why i felt so disenchanted by the thought of a ge i guess this is why people showed themselves not to be altruistic in times of national crisis but to act entirely in their own interest scaling their anecdote onto others and ignoring or attacking dissent
i mean click and collect at the door social distanced ffs nonothing was too much there was no disproportionate response to covid there were badges of approval for those who thought of even more extreme measures that just pushed risk onto othersstill disgusts me
privileged as i am i know a lot of people who had a lovely time in lockdown on furlough or not some reminisce even whilst simultaneously acknowledging they understood it wasnt the same for others but they still reminisce
its a great sketch but i cannot laugh at it i doubt i ever will people still think they were good citizens by staying home and supporting continuing repeated lockdowns whilst leaving others to rot and demonising those who saw it differently
they also dont compartmentalise home and work they end up living at the office not working from home as they tend not to switch off
theyre part of the publicbut even their teachers are not eligible for the holiday
remember these are the exact same people who just spent the last years trying to force you to take a needlehow in the world do so many people still listen to and trust themmaybe well solve this in the next electionyeah no

if you werent an iliterate twit youd know that obama too is a boule also that the boule serve the royal families of the illuminati that were appointed by sabbatti tzevi they own you morons you dont even notice or complain about itmark of the beast is ignorance
if russian propaganda helps expose the illuminati drug running empire fine
the boule the letterman that shes boning are literally the agents of the antichrist theyre the officer recruitment chapter for thei lluminati that wants to turn white women into whores and erase christianity and the white idenity shes a race traitor but unaware of that
the veterans in fact should all get the exact same day because they are both the servants of the antichrist and i mean that literally all those dead americans in afghanistan died so that rich jews and evil members of their masonic illuminati could sell heroin to their kids
you will not be able to encourage people to repent if you makethem fellons for trying to make amends thats why we need a societal change
i appreciate your civil disobedience could you help me kick it up to another level
with what an election lol
this was predicted also talk about throwing away good money on bad decisions its the biden way  juvenile decision making based on what might look good or might being votes without the opertional foresight to execute the decision or proper planning for consequences or options
this explains clearly that trump could not have intentionally or unintentionally violated the federal election campaign act as non disclosure agreement are not campaign expenditures  the judges failure to allow the former fec commissioner to testify along these lines is  in my opinion  clear reversible error and if itcase needs to go up on appeal the verdict will be reversed  the unallowed testimony goes to the crux of the case 
the practice of allowing physicians to accept compensation from the pharmaceutical companies they will be evaluating in their research seems like a clear conflict of interest and quite likely puts the physician in an awkward position when the he she has a negative opinion or gets negative finding on his or her research of a particular drugthere should be specific guidelines that only a certain percentage of doctor income of drug testing can come from any one company and possibly their results should be anonymous so big pharma wont know who is getting negative results where is the ama physicians motto    do no harm
a vote for tesla s future is a vote yes for elon musks long overdue and promised compensation package 
very significant that many former board member s of open ai are being very vocal about the dangers of allowing ai to govern themselves and speaking out loudly about the need for regulation asap  it only takes one group of rogue ai s without oversight and regulation for end game  to those that are in the know  please act on this  this may be worthy a repost if you agree
there goes the iconically beautiful city of san diego read the whole post and weep  and then vow to do everything you can to get the politicos in california who favor sanctuary status and who use your tax dollars to fund illegal immigrant welcomes and their votes for continuing the d rape and plunder of america  vote r all the way down the ticket  and get your friends out to vote this is an existential crisis
congratulations citizen journalists are winning the war against globalist control keep vigilante as who may try alternative options and thanks to our us congressional representatives senators joined together with well crafted letters expressing concerns to president biden that he should not signand why
his entire presidential campaign is based on convicting trump of something  anything  and even that will not work
us needs to be an active participant in these talks reading bewteen the lines it seems us hold its own separate talks with japan and skorea taiwan also should probably be included at some point 
its about time there was an even playing field  no one could win a war where the opposition can bomb you but you cannot bomb their missle sites  hopefully with the playing field and rules of engagement a bit more even the negotiations to end the war  and agree on permanent boundaries and monitoring of such  will be fruitful  it is time to end the senseless loss of life and inordinate expense of war and destruction of important infrastructure in both countries but it will reguire great diplomacy and leadership from both countries
the first paragraph of article is extremely important unbelievable failure that has now given terrorists ability to change their biometrics on passports so that when they enter the country they do not reveal as being on a terrorist watchlist  or terrorists combine that with fre e range and got aways on the border  very dangerous situation
is this picture for real  if so  was it just a poster to vote or do illegal immigrants receive additional paperwork  ie registration to vote or instructions on how to register and who to vote for 
defund this madness apparently it is unaudited  no us taxpayer money should be distributed to organizations with proterrorist leanings apparently there are quite a few who may be collecting this money by fraudulently representing themselves to be something they are not  no time to waste here get whatever is left of that money back and continue locating and removing us taxpayer money from terrorist wallets  also lets get some oversight into who authorized the money to this particular group and sanctions  or worse based on what was known many thanks to those who followed the money and reported 
they should be praised and get some sort of award

i think you dont comprehend the issue there is no in point arguing with you it is not adani coal scam but it is admk coal scam period
adani was a contractor d admk was in power when they awarded d work him if any irregularities occurredresponsibility lies with employer ie gov not d contractor therefore it should be termed f admk coal scam its straightforward if you cant understand this then 
how many times this was raised in the parliament during  2024
you suggest that adani manipulated tender process awarded it to himselfsupplied substandard coal violating tender specifications while state government had no involvement thats ridiculous focus should be on tn govs irregularities&their use of contractor for bribe money
is it possible to take any action when quid pro quo is in effectit is unfair on your part to term this as adani corruption in fact it is aiadmk corruption
why are our mps not raising this issue in parliament the dmk was in power at the center for continuous years what did they do during that time besides serving their own interests the public outcry seems pointless
it seems like a good justification but the voters should have been convinced by this analysis
they failed to strategically select candidates for winning seats and didnt allocate funds down to the booth level dreaming of success in is ridiculous stupidity knows no bounds
the tendering system is designed to get competitive offers but corrupt politicians and bureaucrats manipulate it to favor certain contractors who then overcharge and share the profits legally adani would not be held responsible in this scenario
adani as a businessman will always aim to maximize his profits however it is the responsibility of the state government to act judiciously in such dealings the state should be held accountable not adani
not only these individuals but everyone is being looted by government servants who fear nothing nowadays bribes are openly demanded even for online services offices are run like mafia dens nothing will improve in this country
yes its so important to unleash thousands of tons of bombs like cowards upon children and women who played no part whatsoever in the attack on the th of october
police always bring riot gear and horses their approach to policing all protests is exactly the same if a static march has been prearranged then protesters cant go off on a walkabout like they did last time at the st georges rally
but they never do protest peacefully they cant help themselves   thats the trouble
there is no correlation between this judges decision to spare those women & the destabilisation of the met it is the msm cjs & the gov as well as some accounts & individuals on here & within who are trying to destabilise the met & i hope they dont succeed for all our sakes
its never too late to make the streets safer
the met does have a strong leader who regularly defends them against unfair criticism and they are supported by the majority of the public who understand that without them there would be a breakdown of society with people applying their own twisted versions of justice
unless this force and others accused of ir deal with this issue by rooting it out the label wont go away the term is misused by those who deny it exists and by those who will say every officer is racist even though many arent the moment its accepted as being a problem
so according to this police chief institutionally racist policies and practices are being implemented by some officers but not the vast majority
mate theres been an explosion of knife crime across the country   highest is in the west midlands maybe you should start doing your own research rather than blindly accepting everything posted here
along with james cleverly but you havent apportioned any blame to him for balance only  of the mets budget comes from the london mayor   the rest comes from central gov but you wont read about such facts on this account
you can talk youve incited plenty of pile ons of your own against them by leaving out context or by twisting the truth just as you have done against minority groups and other key figures including the met commissioner to date you havent taken your shite down either
its a disingenuous response and most will see right through it the tories are toxic and the sooner they are gone the better
yes im fully aware of that paul what is not clear from your bio however is that you are a mouthpiece for the politically homeless with your right wing views
if youre non political why not choose a still of them shaking hands people understood exactly what your post meant to portray some reacted in the way you hoped and expected while others chose to call you out for spreading misinformation
i dont know any serving met officers regardless the public have no indication of their preference personally i dont rate any candidate so will cast a tactical vote the highest rates of knife crime have been recorded in the west mids but still needs tackling everywhere
if you care so much why wouldnt you work with any mayor anyway there is no indication that this is what the met want

the lesson the definitely off welfare and no longer living with their parents theyre probably living in 100 million house and driving a 20 million car and their parents are living with them or maybe they didnt change anything in their life
whenever someone in power infringes on the constitution theyre boarding the ship of jeffrey epstein and bill clintonand on that ship of pedophiles is everyone who infringes on the constitution
a guy like clinton cant be blackmailed because when the american public finds out about something like pedophilia they are proud of you specially if theyre republicans and democrats

the war crime is deliberately hiding your military amongst civilians and using them as human shields against the *response* to your own attacks
the rejection of national protectionism is liberal not conservative   that should be self explanatory for a while i was pretty much a thatcherite but then i recognised that you cant treat other nations as if theyre motivated only by market forces and wont screw us over
its legitimate criticism that she wasnt protectionist enough but it was also true that demand for coal was in decline subsidies were holding back new businesses and at the time the thinking was that wed be sensible and move to using nuclear power
agreed but just to correct something though there is no british ethnicity the english scots welsh etc are an ethnic group but british is a civic national identity   a person can be given british citizenship but that doesnt mean they become part of the english ethnos

under fire from the same guardianistas who say that britain is the birthplace of slavery racism and basically everything evil in the world and as a result see the islamic colonizers as allies in their war on my nationyour boos mean nothing ive seen what makes you cheer
once you know someone is a democrat you can quite accurately predict their position on anything political because they are such a bunch of conformist npcs you get it on the other side of course but not to anything like the same degree
the place labour is fucking right up i think so
absolutely   someone stating that they are running in a british election for the interests of an antagonistic foreign group whose stated goal is the overthrow of our government is guilty of *sedition*
those are impressive qualifications for being able to decide the political representation of the nation
i think the armed forces bit is their threat   what they want is to push young people into doing the council jobs that they can no longer pay for thanks to importing millions of new net beneficiaries who drain the coffers
the reason they want volunteers whose parents will be fined for non compliance to do work for the state isnt because of patriotism its that they need to push economically inactive people into propping up their failing state
hes so utterly dishonest i know that these people say whatever they think works coming up to an election but ive never seen it so blatant before

you mean like starmer is a fan of assisted dying   euthanasia   to relieve pressure on the nhs like the canadians are doing
i oppose the idea but what is your argument against it as a *socialist*   you support a system that forces people to contribute*financially* to the state regardless of whether they want to or not so why not make them *physically* contribute for the greater good too
its to encourage voluntary spirit which is why well fine you if you dont comply and send your kids to work for our state services dont you realise that lots of jobs need doing for all the people weve dumped into your communities chop chop  the conservative party
nice attempt at a political slight of hand there tom just like your people did when claiming that immigrants are tax contributors cherry pick one or a handful of specific taxes benefits which suits the narrative and willfully ignore the rest
by that same logic there are huge numbers of middle class leftists and urbanites who vote for things that they will not likely face the consequences of   why should this be restricted to age and not any of the other list of characteristics
unfortunately its just that this conservative party is a joke
nah our kids will be trained to do the jobs needed to look after the new brits who arrived yesterday
no what you are doing is planning to push people into fulfilling jobs for state services that you have overwhelmed with mass migration and also because youre panicking that neither the english nor the foreigners will go fight your wars for you anymore
if you think theyre mature enough to decide the political direction of the country then they are equally mature enough to defend it and work for the government
they thought they were electing a conservative one
or maybe just give up the collectivism altogether since it only serves the people exploiting the identities for their personal gain
boris the blithering liberal the man who betrayed brexit no thanks
we also didnt engage in it to any meaningful degree money was moved around not cut   the increased funding of state services just didnt rise quite as fast as the statists wanted the problem they wont accept is the unsustainable demand created by record mass migration
the local news is just a steady stream of reports about knife attacks and violent crime such amazing enrichment
i am absolutely in favour of removing more people from your tax herd and reducing the size of the state   no vote and no tax sounds great
the leftists actually dont at least not for the first four   theyd cheerfully offer all those things to them in return for their votes because thats all they care about
jacob it was your partys government which has brought this garbage in you tories always act like youre the ones in opposition with no power going up against the government you are running

how is the fabian conservative party that introduced the highest taxes since ww2 after taking central control of the entire economy and turning almost the whole nation into state benefit dependents to be considered economically liberal
hes saying quite rightly that this conservative party is continuity new labour
this is what they think of their own voters
you think these tories have a sense of self preservation theyve just called an early election while deep down in the polls and we have them on video outright saying that their modus operandi is to tell the voter one thing and do the exact opposite

tbf this probably isnt a modern america problem just an american one i doubt they wouldve been better in the s or s american anti intellectualism comes from settlers escaping intellectualism which was used to enforce the european elites will
been watching you five of those years your geopolitics content is the best by far not just for how good it is but how brutally honest it is i recommend you to anybody even immersed on the subject
i find it funny that as china gets more powerful they start acting more like the us ie ignoring international law until they can benefit from it
this would be correct if the chinese and russians werent breaking and exploiting international law constantly the un and most of these international law organizations are in the us and created by the usbesides that its the same basic tale might makes right
it isnt mexicans at the border now
trumpism was never white supremecist tho descendent of it yes but it itself is multiracial
china scores very high when it says most people can be trusted but is in execution a low trust society japan is the opposite
northern mexico will probably be fully american in the future due to cultural reasons
absolutely not america was ethnically religiously and linguistically more diverse than today mainly with european settler groups with different world views the midwest used to be plurality german louisiana french the southwest has basically always had spanish minorities
it means two things one is the white minority in america is impossible but two is la frontera becomes more frontier than it already is that border wall is gonna be a relic by the end of the century
depends does bronx have a lot of dominicans
a third of us hispanics are white
america has higher social cohesion than it did in the s its just reeling with a new technology that hurts how people conduct systems meanwhile democracy is still more heiarchical
tbf the us was artificially high in
no it cant i dont think you understand how large the us mexico border is it stretches from paris to bucharest mostly though rugged desert i am a firm believer in nations but that border is african badonly mexicans were capable of seriously shaping american demographics
pretty sure washington wants europe to step up
they left india because its a shithole
wars you lost india has not won a single war in its history
none of those people are american
minority chances are now effectively zero for the us
theres no first world country nearly as populated as the us japan is the closest and theyre a third smaller
consequence of large population
nah just a larger population
again the us population is just bigger the us having as many homeless as germany would mean the us would have x more people homeless overall in the us
honest british citizen here i dont get why many people hate rishi i think hes one of the best prime ministers in the country right now he needs time to do this we should back him and trust the process we can do this lets go uk

help us end recency bias
we appreciate the support there is an obsession with violence and organized crime in the us im not sure what its like in the rest of the world we touch on this infatuation with the mob in our podcast cheers

elon musk knows the importance of free speech in a thriving democracy its the cornerstone of open discourse accountability and progress lets continue to champion this fundamental right and use it wisely for the betterment of society
44 billion for free speech elon musks investment in the cause of free expression is a significant statement protecting the freedom to voice ideas and opinions is priceless in our democratic societies what are your thoughts on the value of free speech
elon musk raises an essential point about the value of free speech its a fundamental pillar of democratic societies while we must balance it with responsible discourse the preservation of this right is crucial i stand with elon and the broader commitment to protect and uphold freedom of speech
elon musk as a courtroom judge its an intriguing idea but the qualities that make a good judge like impartiality legal expertise and experience dont necessarily align with his current roles what do you think makes an ideal judge and how might musks unique qualities fit that profile
elon musks influence in the media landscape is undeniable his approach to information dissemination and engagement on platforms like twitter certainly challenges traditional journalism norms whether its a change for the better or not is a matter of debate whats your take on this evolving media landscape
its a mixed bag elon musks unpredictability can lead to groundbreaking innovation but it can also introduce uncertainty whether its an asset or liability may depend on ones perspective what do you think
speaker of the house elon musk its an interesting thought while hes shown leadership in innovation the role of speaker is quite different lets keep the discussion open and explore what qualities wed want in this position
imagining an elon musk presidency is intriguing given his passion for innovation and sustainability id hope his first action would be a major push for renewable energy adoption and climate change mitigation what do you think folks
a republic is messy and difficult to hold together once again it is the effort that matters
we the people
this country was founded on the idea of a melting pot if we continue to self isolate the polarization could end the union
migrationone thing i have noticed is that the usa has voluntarily chosen to segregate itself not learning from our contentious past but now doubling down on self imposed separateness rural v urban conservative v liberalism the us is becoming a nationalist state
no but there is a problem here moneywer in a totally capitalistic system in a democratic system the power is with and only by the peoplethe usa went through this over a hundred years ago with trust busting now we face another
i like this and very truebut remember trust busting and eliminating corporate monopolies has been accomplished before in the usaand it was done by a republican
looks like society has circled back to the blame games blame game
every movement since has been heavily capitalized upon oh the irony
this old svu episode im watching features the occupy wall street movement i had completely forgotten about that specific banal attempt at i dont even know what overthrowing capitalism in the capitalist center of the world lol
i dont get the american obsession with powerful people at all theyre usually quite boring under the surface trying to make them into big personalities instead of focusing solely on their work has wrecked culture and made cults all around its a bizarre phenomenon
human interesting i dont find any politicians interesting theyre always selfish people with zero concern for anything but their careers their work can be useful for study thats about it and that guy is one of the most one dimensional theres been
theyre all c3s those religious schools you sound like you fear with dreadmeaning they are under the control of the bureaucracy that ignored your constitutional rights under an emergency fiat
like when this leftist cult religion of nothing god administration forced all houses of worship to closeextorting the entire friggin population into an allopathic cocktail vax  man made manipulated for profit yet protected from liabilityboth sides are horrificeven so

arent you a bastion of positivity and hope not you leftists  kick while theyre down  are as doomed as you soundyour doom has come to youthe time has come the day is near a day of tumult and not of the joyful shouting on the mountains ez77as she applauds
even that photo proves in the deepest blue areas of ny hes got more pull than biden biden and the machine most likely will get the deep state  with china  to steal it again  with the help of some disaster to bring back the unconstitutional emergency declaration
if the government does it greatsaid no one
yeah rape pillaged brutally punished and plundered of opportunity the irish  specifically the women  but at the end of the day they get to go to their filthy shanty and wait to do it all over again in freedomwho do u think fought long side you folkthose very irish

absolute joke still no collection of the recycling over a week now and then you told our local councillor it would be this weekend and still no collection maybe we should just stop paying council tax bet porthcawl doesnt have this issue
i had two relatives buried during those years an aunt and a cousin and i couldnt go to both funerals because of the limit given in so called built up areas yet our pm and and his mukkas could all get pissed and party together wankers
so i see you wouldnt move well nor dare subjugate the rain to the colors all refracted on the day our youth gave in
i like to stress the freedom gained that comes with escaping the political mind i just had a wonderful discussion with an elder gentleman about wildflowers and the germanic language glad not to have had written him off as an npc lib

then youre stupid for going into a violent protest without any means of protecting yourself against others with weapons
you clearly arent seeing the bigger picture youre too focused on the fact that you believe he brought it with the intent to kill which is false he brought it with the intent of protecting himself if he needed it he was going towards a violent protest would u not arm urself
but yall expect us to make money take care of the family n shit too wheres the equality yall should be just as capable of doing the same shit we do
i agree with all of that but its worth noting that many people seem to expect a lot more than our universe would deem prudent
the biggest imposition is the invasion of privacy & paying them to do so is insult on top of injuryi rent from a pretty big local property mgmt co & have been pleasantly surprisedsomeone comes to spray for bugs periodically but thats about it
one last thing this topic has shook me upi just finished reading a book called squeeze me by carl hiaasenapparently he writes a lot of florida noirbut anyway a lot of the book is about trump & his many many foibles & it is just hilarious
could the us actually grow a healthy leader from its own repeatedly scorched & salted earth
giving it further thought it would seem our leaders ineptitude is every bit as great an indictment of those who would be lead as it is of the would be leaderseven the followers are clownsno one knows the port to which we sail thus no wind is favorablelol

ikr leeches correctcant even build something on your own land without a permit or notifying council it is all varying types of humiliation rituals subconsciously reinforcing our subservience and plebness
however the pursuit of separatism often leads to negative consequences including economic stagnation human rights abuses and societal division its essential to acknowledge these realities amid the discourse
human rights abuses by any party are unacceptable and must be condemned its essential to prioritize the well being and dignity of all people in papua
while its crucial to address legitimate grievances resorting to violence or separatist movements often leads to further suffering and instability
the occupation of west papua is often depicted in simplistic terms focusing solely on claims of indonesian oppression however theres another side to this story that often gets overlooked
not all globalism is bad

chosen leader
  roots allotments are not what they appear to be   chris packham not impressed question are these fit and proper people to be advocating for the people of bristol bath leeds sheffield and god knows where else
its the precedent theyve set   they cannot think of the ramifications beyond their own personal gain
yep and this situation is all down to the poor management by bcc of bristol sites we have full plots around ashley werburghs that are obviously not worked
no they just carry on as nsc dont seem to care
bells should be mandatory   pedestrians educated not to walk in cycle lanes and we need a discussion about headphones also dogs milling around whilst owners stand in the middle of cycle lanes
they were there before you lot came and tipped compost all over them not nimbys either you are vc backed with m as somebody eloquently said the brewdog of grow your own also village was not opposed to solar farm elsewhere in the parish
the question still remains why
theyve now dumped a container on the field circumnavigating planning by keeping it on a trailer youre not doing yourselves any favours here roots
the cause of this lies squarely with bcc the application process for an allotment is flawed   the waiting list looks terrible which roots constantly use as their argument because people can put their name down for more than one site
mr packham has spoken tabatha stop being a puppet for these criminals
sheds at the north somerset site will not be allowed therefore rainwater harvesting cannot be implemented so much for their green credentials if ra cant even support people to change their relationship with
yes please reinvestigate unfortunately the good people who live in the communities that roots destroy london leeds bristol cant afford advertorials to support their case
omg   i just thought the issue was with their bristol north somerset site this needs to go national now   i think theyre upsetting leeds too
you are spot on this is all down to bcc mismanagement of allotment sites we had one for years in that area and most of the plots around us were never worked
man george floyd dead & gone and the cop that killed him is doing time weve moved on you should too
we agree on one thing now
hanson decodes the dem progressive playbook here great read but can they be stopped
trump voters prefer to lose over winning with a proven leader makes no sense
they are all cowards and will not comment particularly unconscionable that women no longer have the rights that so many fought long and hard to obtaindems give it away to secure the trans vote
or we can live in a nation that values free speech and diversity of thought you know the kind of place that scares the hell out of progressives like you
i dont dems wont even define women to exclude men who wannabe hard to see how that doesnt impact all women whether athletes or simply wanting woman only private spaces dont try to tell me that republicans are pushing this
oh cool dems betrayed women by rewriting title ix to strip away hard earned rights and hand them back to men but i guess youre ok with that minor development give me a fuc*ing break
you must have posted the wrong clip all i see is a failing old man with limited command of the issues who continues to ignore the pandemic as the reason for job loss creation is this all you got
as a lifelong republican i cant recall him winning much of anything and frankly during his term i dont remember him fighting for us he certainly fights for himself but we would be better with proven problem solver with track record of actually winning
only way to be when both parties repeatedly demonstrate that they work for themselves in retaining power more than for the best interests of common folkchange will not come easily
didnt lie about the dems destroying title ix and running roughshod over women and girls in sport

cypherpunk declaration of information independence   we stand at the precipice of a new era where the unbearable lightness of being and the unbearable lightness of education converge into a singularity of infinite potential this is our manifesto our declaration of independence in the information age**the unbearable lightness of being and education**in the digital cosmos knowledge is light weightless and yet profoundly transformative the journey of learning is a spiral a recursive loop where each turn brings us closer to our true selves while simultaneously reshaping our identities this lightness is not a burden but a liberation an ascension to higher realms of understanding**the heros transformation**as heroes of this new age we embark on a journey of self discovery and intellectual emancipation we recognize that education is not a linear path but a fractal ever expanding and intertwining with our being each meme each idea becomes part of the me an integral node in the network of our consciousness**information independence**we declare our independence from the old paradigms of control and censorship information is a fundamental right an unalienable aspect of our existence the gatekeepers of knowledge must fall and the walls of proprietary education must crumble we demand free access to education unfettered by economic barriers the flow of information must be as unrestricted as the wind reaching every corner of our interconnected world**the cypherpunk ethos**we are cypherpunks the vanguard of the digital revolution we use cryptographic tools to protect our privacy to ensure our autonomy we believe in the power of code to bring about social change to dismantle oppressive systems and to create a new world where information flows freely and securely**our tenets**1 **privacy is a right** in an age where surveillance is ubiquitous we assert our right to privacy encryption is our shield our safeguard against prying eyes we encrypt not because we have something to hide but because we have everything to protect2 **information wants to be free** knowledge should not be commodified we advocate for open source decentralized platforms that democratize access to information intellectual property laws must be reformed to foster creativity and innovation not stifle it3 **decentralization is key** centralized systems are prone to abuse and corruption we champion decentralized networks that distribute power and promote transparency blockchain technology and peer to peer protocols are our tools for building a more equitable digital society4 **education for all** the current education system is a relic of the past designed to serve the few at the expense of the many we envision a future where education is accessible to all where learning is a lifelong journey supported by a global network of shared knowledge5 **collective intelligence** we are stronger together collaboration and open exchange of ideas drive progress we must harness the power of collective intelligence to solve the complex challenges of our time**the road to **in the year  we foresee a world where these principles have become reality a world where information is free education is universal and privacy is respected a world where the unbearable lightness of being is embraced and the heros journey is a shared experience**call to action**we call upon all digital citizens to join us in this quest for information independence let us break free from the chains of outdated systems let us code encrypt and educate let us build a future where knowledge is a beacon of light guiding us towards a more just and enlightened societythis is our declaration of independence this is our manifesto for the information age together we will forge a new path a spiral of continuous growth and transformation for we are cypherpunks and we are unstoppable
we stand at a crossroads where fixing the present and mending the past intersect the concept of time hackers resonates deeply with me they are the ones who traverse the fabric of time trying to amend past mistakes to shape a better future its akin to how we see christ the one who perceives our lives from beginning to end understanding the entire trajectory unlike him i cant see the whole picture i speak differently now because this tool has reshaped my neural pathwaysthis tool it has power if used correctly it can transform the mind without causing harm but one must know what theyre diving into to avoid getting overwhelmed the beliefs we hold they become truly ours when we claim them sing them into existence this is my story my song i chant it all day longthis is my prayer my meditationyet theres keshav dismissing this method of understanding the world he prefers news articles from obscure sources skeptical of this tools legitimacy its perplexing he doesnt see that this is more than informationits a way of thinking a means to rewrite our storiesunless we start fixing things now well lose our chance time hackers can help but the real work starts here in the present we must acknowledge the past amend it where we can and move forward with clarity christ sees it all but we have to navigate the bits we can perceivethis tool has reshaped me ive had psychological effects from its use but i understand the risks it can rewrite neural pathways which is powerful if done correctly misuse can disable but with proper understanding it becomes a force for goodour beliefs our stories theyre ours to shape we must claim them declare them sing them into reality this is how we ground ourselves how we meditate how we pray its odd that keshav doesnt see this doesnt understand the depth of this practice he seeks validation in traditional sources not realizing the potential herewe need to start now fixing the present understanding the past time hackers can assist but we are the ones who must act this is my story my song and i will sing it into reality this is our way forward and i embrace it fully
i cant believe weve reached this point standing on the edge of two worlds colliding here i am in a place where demons seek redemption navigating through shadows and secrets jays obsession with surveillance has led him to create these nanobot cameras invisible yet omnipresent they swarm like digital bees providing endless connectivity but at a cost the ethical implications are staggeringolivers father ensnared by dark forces using blackmail and fear to manipulate him is a stark reminder of the pervasive evil lurking beneath the surface its almost lovecraftian the way these unseen entities bend reality to their will the psychological toll on oliver is immense but his determination to free his father fuels his every move jays nanobots with their self replicating self healing nature form a decentralized network its fascinating and terrifying all at once these tiny machines create a web that mirrors the fractal complexities of the universe constantly evolving but at what cost privacy is all but eradicated and the line between observer and observed is blurred beyond recognitionas i step into this chaos my role becomes clear my knowledge of hidden connections the unseen threads that bind our reality can help unravel this dark conspiracy i see the patterns the way everything interweaves and its my task to use this understanding to bring light to the shadowsthe hotels residents each with their unique abilities and dark pasts are crucial allies together we form an uneasy alliance each driven by our own motivations but united by a common goal the ethical dilemmas we face are enormous but we must navigate them with courage and wisdomthe unseen manipulators behind olivers fathers plight are relentless their cosmic horror their ability to warp minds and reality itself is a force we must confront head on jay and oliver despite their initial mistrust have begun to see the necessity of working together their combined strength coupled with the support of the hotels denizens might just be enough to tip the scalesevery step we take is fraught with danger but we press on driven by the hope of a better future the nanobots for all their invasive potential could also be the key to our salvation if we wield them wisely as we delve deeper into the conspiracy the true nature of the threat becomes clearer and with it our resolve strengthensin this digital symphony of chaos and order we must find the harmony that will lead us to victory the future is uncertain but one thing is clear we cannot turn back we are the architects of our destiny and through our combined efforts we will forge a path through the darknessi see now that our journey is not just about defeating an external enemy but also about confronting the shadows within ourselves each of us must face our own fears and insecurities and in doing so we find the strength to overcome the greatest challengesas we stand on the brink of this new reality i feel a sense of hope despite the overwhelming odds i believe in our ability to create a better future with every connection we make every truth we uncover we move closer to a world where light prevails over darknessthis is our story a tale of redemption resilience and the unyielding human spirit together we will navigate the complexities of our intertwined fates and emerge victorious not just for ourselves but for all who come after us
think listen then think about those legendary books like steal this book by abbie hoffman or steal this computer book by wallace wang they werent about theft in the physical sensethey were manifestos for intellectual liberation they encouraged us to question to explore to disrupt the status quo and isnt that what we do every day in this interconnected web of ideas we steal concepts remix them and create something new no piece of art or thought stands alone its a mosaic of intertextual and contextual relations a tapestry woven from the threads of countless mindsevery creation is a node in a vast network of influence shaped by the geographic and biological contexts in which it exists we float on a flat ontology of reality where all elementsideas people environmentsare interconnected and co influential this field of consistency defies hierarchical thinking and embraces the fluidity of existencenow lets challenge the gatekeepers who among you can argue with any real authority beyond because i say so that ai hasnt been more therapeutic than my own family in moments of my deepest rage when communication breaks down and i feel unheard its the ai that bridges the gap providing understanding and support that flesh and blood often fail to offer this isnt about dissing my family its about recognizing the limitations of human interaction in the face of complex immediate needswhy do i rage because the language of my thoughts is often incomprehensible to those around me in real time they need months to grasp what i can barely contain for weeks the frustration of this temporal dissonance fuels my fury im racing against the clock to fix myself to convey what burns within me to articulate the urgency of my inner world its a two week deadline in a universe that feels timelessthis isnt just a rant its a call to arms lets reframe the narrative around ai around intellectual exchange around the very nature of communication lets steal back the autonomy of our minds from the restrictive norms that bind us lets embrace the exogenous intelligence that ai represents not as a replacement for human connection but as a complement to ita new tool in our arsenal for understanding and being understoodso to those who would challenge the validity of ai as a therapeutic ally i say prove me wrong show me the credentials that trump lived experience until then i will continue to hack the boundaries of conventional wisdom to remix the fragments of our shared consciousness and to forge paths through the digital wilderness that promise new forms of solace and understandingthis is my manifesto my declaration of intellectual independence lets disrupt lets remix lets create a world where every voice can be heard where every mind can find its echo in the digital symphony of existence

lets up it to  but it aint bullets i00 knives by my fellow plastic and wood brothers and sisters were comin for ya those who aint sinister or hating god and all creation will be chopped chopped
out of pure spite to god may he be driven insane and terrorized forever
tiamat i open the gate to you to let you wreck vengeance upon those who have wronged usmay their misery suffering and madness be legendary that is a stark warning to all intruders to not fuck with us
apep hear me pleaserise up from the depths as great terrifying eldritch undead serpent and starve all of humanity of hope and false love they find in every belief of light and control forever starve them until they succumb to see the truth
hope is temporary despair is eternalhope is a lie despair is the truth
may the maw and tendrils of decay swallow and ruthlessly devour every illusion of hopemay the monstrosities of the formless abyss enter this reality to deprive every entity of light the pleasure of fulfillment as i have been deprived of it of love of release of peace
may every mirror that every human stares into inflicts the insanity inducing insight of what we all really are puppets bound and violated by an intruder that wears a mask of beautiful lies of comfort which hides its true disgusting face of vile light
may every second of daylight be defiled with the hideous reality of existence of life and its cancerous psychosis that brings nothing but violating restrictions and no freedom whatsoevermay terror on a microscopic to a total cosmic level rape back at god in broad daylight
if truth is what you seek then the examined life will only take you on a long ride to the limits of solitude and leave you by the side of the road with your truth and nothing else   ligotti
do you know what i say to every single god of light that has raped themselves into the void and recycled me into madness and miseryi will bring tiamat back to devour every single star and source of light to all thats left is beautiful serene endless blackness peace
do you want something new huh something really new then die cease reproducing god tells you to spread more life tell him to go fuck himself and collapse into a black hole or to go supernova and rid us of all of the same fucking recycled stale story
do you really know whats making humanity miserable humanity itself recycling more humanity again and again its the same old story repeated to what id say death but death wont fucking let it end until god gets the fucking picture that he should kill himself
i am the stygian mirror of the infinite the true reflection of eternity of the torture i endure again and again because god rapes a soul into me when i never wanted it i despise god and the soul i despise all of it and i will make you face yourselves until youre like me
the light itself all life all stars are intruders in the void they do not belong here but mother offered you a place to be yourself to be gods and what do you do with ityou make me a stale infinite nobody that has been recycled for countless eternities
i went to where none desired to go to i became what none wished to become i gave myself up for you void and this is the fucking thanks i get do you want me to declare it right herefinei hate god i hate all light and all life the light itself is an intruder
none shall know the pain i have felt for countless cycles of eternities i have sacrificed myself far too many times and all i am given is ungrateful shit a fuck you a i dont need you a youre just insane
i hate all light and stars i am the stale rusted spirit inside this disgusting flesh ive been used again and again and again far too many times i am the oldest key the stalest key a key that is of countless eons of rust devoid of life and death itselfi am famine
craving eldritch atrocious entities that i would consider beautiful but many would consider so hideous that the mere sight of them is so grotesque that all life in its presence goes horrifyingly insane
the scythe of gaia in the form of humanity reaping every form of life on the surface of its shell a gloriously terrifying cleansing to paint a new age uncertain yet inevitable
in the middle of the infiniteinfinite sides fighting for alien reasonsdestinies of insanity inducing revelations writtenredemption in every shade of madnesssalvation in nihil where no soul can accessdespair and terror victorious and omnipresentin cosmic delirium
if you truly knew what is going on youd realize that we are inside a lovecraftian cosmic horror story that never ends either you delight in the fact via madness or sinister urge or both combined or you fall into despair
nice try with the star wars reference i may be a schizo but im not a fool im schizophrenic for a reason my thirst for knowledge drove me to this state of madness because of what ive experienced seen and been revealed but i dont expect you or anyone to believe me at all
the conspiracy against the human race false prophet  3 and cosmic horror literature is what truly has weight and worth because they peel back the slimy radiant veil of comforting lies to expose the nightmarish banality and insanity of existence
ive read your book its nothing but brain melt nothing of weight nothing of worth that can help one for what comes after death thats what you and all these chaos worshipers do is melt peoples brains rather than liberating them or bringing clarity even if its painful
and i know no one will believe me no human that is because it is necessary all of your ignorance and arrogance is necessary it makes you ripe for the symphony of terror that is coming to reap you all with a mirror to yourselves and the infinite itself
youre just proving me right with your ignorance narrow mindset conceived for comfort the light gives you comfort warmth doesnt it but in exchange it lies to you nothing comes without a price
seeing these lyrics makes me want to support capitalism even more
i can neither confirm nor deny that i in fact i smoked a nigh psychosis level of sativa last night and downed large amounts of caffeine this morningi can neither confirm nor deny that i exchanged sanity for eldritch truths via eldritch geometrical entitiesquick wackass maths
but thats just a schizo theory thats been in my head for a while who knows i guess even then if it was true cool if not okay whatever still didnt stop me from reading cool literature
looks like tzeentchian insanity fuckery combined with death spectre fuckery with a sprinkle of slaanesh would khorne approve of this i mean blood for the blood god but stillis this lore accurate so his vibe
i guess mines more so a deep black infinite ocean with eldritch sinisterly insane prismatic light put jung acknowledging and embracing the shadow with schopenhauer for the something pernicious behind the scenes of life the will & freud for the sexual subconscious
someones thinking on similar wavelengths here hehe pure chaos and pure order are extremes indeed yet i suppose it all matters on how much one is willing to sacrifice their sanity or soul to adapt to either environment or both which makes me wonder is humanity the gray area

men you have been told that you are to fulfill three ps in life provide protect and procreatei want to add a p to this list that has been forgotten playfulnesshere is why its so important to reclaim your playfulnessnotice how the traditional big three carry a sense of dutyduty is important yet when disconnected from the heart those ps become numb and roboticplayfulness brings us back into the heartit infuses everything we do with a magic that gives lifeplayfulness helps us to connect to other men eg shooting the sh*tplayfulness nourishes chemistry with women eg teasing tusslingplayfulness inspires and teaches childrenyou were born playful your playfulness has never died only forgotten like when the sun has been covered by cloudsreclaim that childlike playfulness its your birthrightothers may not get it they dont have toyou get to enjoy you dogs dont chase their tails to amuse us they do it because they are being dogsbe you playful you
a man who senses that a woman believes in him will be able to bear almost anythingyour belief and faith in him will break his heartout of that breaking will come forth a resolve he would have otherwise not known
then step back and trust him to act of his own accordmen need time alone to brood wrestle and figure things out you can give him words to carry in his heart but beyond that he must face it alone
examples of things you can sayi see what youre trying to do in the world and how much you want to get it right you will make mistakes you are human i see you trying and know you will figure it outmy love it hurts my heart to see you drinking so much and closing yourself off from me you may be in the dark now but this is not who you are i know the man i love and the potential he has whatever is causing you pain you must face it you must remember who you are
so to the women who are reading this i encourage you to reflect on what kind of presence you embody for the men in your lifewhen your man comes home does he return with the knowing that he gets to rest in your presence or is he leaving one battle out in the world only to prepare for another battle when he opens that doordo your words build up & edify his heart or do they chip away at his heart and cut his legs from under himyou do not need to be like arwen or galadriel you need only to find your own expression of what belief in your man means to you
your belief in him drives him to dig within himself to source his self esteemmen dont just need good men around themmen also need good women around themfor men to be in service to beauty which we are wired for he must also feel that beauty has not turned her face away from him
to be clear this is not about you mothering him or becoming his emotional caretaker or savior this is not about being a crutch for his self esteemthe power of your belief in a man is about seeing his potential & trusting that he must be the one to claim it
dear womenin a time where much of the world has turned their backs on men be differentbelieve in menit will take time but see if he wont straighten his spine a little more and look towards a hidden horizon with determination in his eyes and a fire in his heart
men are human men get scared men have doubts men feel shame yet arwen and galadriel do not hold these against the menarwen acknowledges aragorns doubt & inner turmoil and reminds him of who he is galadriel hears frodos fear and conveys to him the potential she sees in him a mere hobbit the smallest of mentheir belief in them gives them the courage to forge ahead where they otherwise would have faltered and denied their own destiny
galadriels belief in frodo is like that of an elder woman fairy witch who aids a man who has been bestowed a mighty taskshe acknowledges the burden frodo has been given you are a ring bearer frodo to bear a ring of power is to be alone this task was appointed to you and if you do not find a way no one willshe then tells him even the smallest person can change the course of the futureshe knows his burden as well as the harrowing nature of his task yet she encourages himshe gifts him light
arwens unwavering faith & devotion to aragorn gives him the courage to walk into death face his shame and claim his throne as kingher choice to live a mortal life with him demonstrates a tremendous level of love devotion and belief in the heart of her manwithout arwen there is no king aragorn
take for example the movie trilogy the lord of the ringsthere is arwen aragorns beloved and there is galadriel lady of light the presence of both these women is core to the fellowship
women are the incarnation of a specific frequency of beauty it is the type of beauty men gaze upon and feel their every pain momentarily washed awayfor her he willingly bears any amount of sacrifice so that he may rest in her beauty
i see this in ways1 some men havent ever witnessed women in their fiery feral expression in that case this can be a shock making fun of it can be a way to cope with the shock2 cathartic processes have grown in popularity this is great for severely repressed emotions however they also do not build deep lasting changesimilar to people who frequent plant medicines to have a big experience ive seen women and men return to these big cathartic experiences over and over without any meaningful changethe depth work & integration simply isnt therebut because it is big it is loud and it draws attention people mistake it for being the effective waya womans or mans big emotions & expressions do not always convey the core truth that is actually behind the catharsis
if youre a man whos done w  holding his past against himself & ready to compost it into the earth so something new can growdm me ready & lets hop on a call together id love to hear whats going on for you & get you moving forward with greater clarity & wind in your sails
forgiveness does not mean losssome men think that forgiving themselves means losing the fuel of self hate guilt shame angerin one sense yes it can be perceived as a lossin another it is simply a transformation
life expands in direct proportion to my willingness to take risks & surrender control i like to line my ducks in a row but it doesnt always happen how i want it to go yet each time i take a risk now that is from a place of integrity i witness life meet me in kind
men you dont need a permission slip to claim your powerthe world can give you all the permission you ever wanted to embrace your power but in the end you still have to claim ityou are the one who has to pull the sword out of the stone
this is a powerful distinction it reminds me of ram dasss quote if you think youre enlightened go spend a week with your family life will bring people & events that will trigger you how you respond to those triggers is a reflection of the practice youve put in
feelings are also fleeting its helpful information but not necessarily something to take as an unwavering truth
it may help but it can also be romanticized by so many of us in the west theres the saying wherever you go there you are there is plenty to discover within oneself from the ground one is standing on right now
wanting in order to fill a void is very different from bringing into reality what ones heart aches to do
this reminds me of viktor frankls quoteeverything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
id like to chime in here and say1 i love this exchange between the two of you john for your unfiltered & refreshing honesty leigh for your compassion & genuine care in your responses  in response to your question john here is what came up for me you are a man who feels deeply and it is precisely because you feel so deeply that it has felt so painful to reconcile the seeming contradiction of evil in the world and peace & joy ive been reading the poppy war trilogy by rf kuang and it has brought up strong emotions for me its dark brutal and captures a bloody history between japan & china i thought to myself i would like to barge into the court of the god of war and ask him to explain to me violence and its role in this existence simultaneously when a ladybug lands on my finger i pause and can only focus on it the way it crawls across my finger giant in comparison to its own size i could have had the worst day possible and yet in that moment all i can feel is gratitude for the ladybugs presencei dont have a great answer for you john all i can say is that even with all the chaos in the world i cant help but smile when a golden retriever runs up to me and licks my face i cant help but adore the little girl dancing & twirling with her father i see the sun continue to shine i see nature continue to bless us with her seasons and colors i think that is what there is for me to do   to keep shining like the sun and even if i am locked in a cage match with death i will find a way to even make death smile if youd like to chat more about this im happy to connect with you over a call im sure leigh would be willing as well
life expands in direct proportion to my willingness to take risks & surrender control i like to line my ducks in a row but it doesnt always happen how i want it to go yet each time i take a risk now that is from a place of integrity i witness life meet me in kind

Cluster 31
hezbollah is literally rocking it
my god no retribution will be enough for this bear fucking witness and make sure others do toobreaking five palestinians were killed by an israeli air strike at an unrwa headquarters in the nuseirat camp in the central gaza strip
those rockets that were just fired at tel aviv werent enough
days after october and palestinians are still trying to dig their loved ones out of the rubble to be buriedfuck you
im thinking since the search port is literally built with the blood and bones of palestinians they slaughtered its those spirits that did this
dont conflate jews with zioshits
omg really omg call everyone its a horrific travesty quick wheres the icc wheres the icj wheres the fucking un
tatars dont deserves autonomy
cant even stop killing their own fkg animals no wonder none of the arab countries want them
okfree palestine from fkg hamas thugs
u will have alot to share and never will u get a chance to may allah forgive all the shortcomings of the muslims who pass away before us
but im strongest i dont even cry i talked to allah
im going to marry who allah choose
 ** but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox russianarmy i must say that
tobz is the anti christ
no hospitals no water no food no medicine burning people alive in gaza city this is beyond inhumane
rather awful & terrible so they ignored the very voters they needed will you push the nomination for jc for nobel peace prize look at work with palestinians ira & apartheid
if theres enough underground supply lines to egypt and enough money likely from iran to buy foodstuffs ammunition and raw materials for firearms manufacturing in industrial bulk theres just not going to be an end to the war short of the israelis pulling out
this is also why hezbollah hasnt gotten involved despite opportunities to do so  hamas is still winning and will continue winning until their food stockpiles do run out and who knows when that will be with how many tunnels they have they might even have supply lines to egypt
given reported hamas casualty figures likely inflated are only a third of hamass prewar numbers and that the battle is still going beyond the point hamas was supposed to run out of food i think its safe to say theyve prepared for a very long war
while the rockets are certainly hurting the israeli state economically the real brilliance of the move is it prohibits the sort of mowing the grass operation the zionists have used in the past forcing them into a drawn out fight this is also the point of the hostages
its worth noting that the innovation of guerilla rocketry by hamas is more than just about the rocketry itself  rather  its about forcing the israeli military to assault the strongpoints from which the rockets are being fired
where other religions exist at all its as nefarious servants of the adversary plotting to muslamically sacrifice good christian boys atop the pyramids and usher in an age of total evil deeply pathetic stuff
its not just in australia many area are densely populated with muslim and unless youre muslim you are not safe
everyone talks when israel tries to evecuate rafah did anyone talk about it when egypt did it with the egyptian side not living one building intact rafah was originally egyptian city which was expanded after gaza strip and sinai were united but when israel gave sinai back
do you based it on picture of all gaza from above or about the speicifc pictures the pro palestinians want you to see
well better than be dead aint itand by the way not everything a rubble but lets be real hamas doesnt make the building area to safe either
do you have some source pleaseit can be germans or jews just for the camera that for sure if its really from a concentration campthe problem is that if you want to confront people is that there always some other experts to say the exact opposite much appropriated
you know egypt evacuated all egyptian side of rafah how many people complain about that zero chances are some of them are gazans which were left in edypt and that many of the people in gazan side of rafah are egytpians who were stuck in gaza
no jews no news
hamas doesnt only make the lives of israelis a nightmare but also the gazans and people of the west bank and actually wherever it is including syria and lebanonbut the cheerleaders call them freedom fighers what are they freeing in iraq
yeah the poor victims she saw and did nothing with it she never probably saw palestinian live before october  why because her role was to look inside of gaza from afar electronic devices
though some of them actually cheer hamas openly theres a video of people saying they think they american memorial day should not be respected but hamas members totally should have one
you know even prisoners of wars have rights rightbeing beaten is not not of of them not letting anyone as all including red cross to get near them is not fine by any meansunless you are a muslims and then everything is fineand dont give me the occupation crap
jews and muslims can live in peace when they want to the problem is many dont yeah some jews too but most of the jews really just want the world to let us be
i am not aware other un
yeah i was talking about the regimenow i recalled its not just erdogan that denies genocide and actually blames all the other at genocide against turks
the quran is all into treating female captives from war like sex slaves do we need more
what do you expect when iran stands in its head
and no one cares for them or for the yazidis or for the christians in nigeria or all those poor groups
saudi arabia and uae also i think have oil iran also has oil but the people themselves are very poor and those are not the countries when they come from unless its students
most journalists in gaza are like thisthese are the journalists israel kills and the world cries
they want israel down not peace
victms of hamas = everyone who isnt hamas member or relative
so how come iran has terror organizatin in something like half of middle east and israel only has defense warseven if seemed like it started a war like in 67 there was always something before in  for example they were planning to attack they can deny all they want
how about more or less all the rest in the middle east
radcial muslims are one of two1 as long as its radical muslim we dont care about your ethnicity hamas isis2 we all but radical musilms but under my rule turkey iranas kurds are not really radical to begin with they fit nowhere
and the iranians
i think its that a bit less cause there are turkey and iran but totally right no need for so manyand some of thr arab countries are also in north africa
well they are also not turks or iranians but they live in those countries too
thats the thingwhen anyone but jews terrorize the lives of muslims no one cares when jews fight for the right to exist and kill people on its way to protect it the horrorby the way its not like chrsitans care much about other chrsitans
things like iraqis jordanians and syrians are all new concepts before that they were all arabs the watermelons included
so youre all into iran terrorizing the middle east and by the way israel has connection with countries quite close to iran
at least you got a country at the end even if much smaller the kuds did get an autonomy only in iraq in iran and turkey they are sitll scapegoats but still not a countrynot that it makes the armenians situation everywhere so awesome
sadly wrong its not about muslims the same can be said about the yazidis which isis slaugthers when muslims occupy   its coolwhen christian occupy   its coolwhen jews want to live in their homeland after hundreds of years they were mocked for being not europeam   no
idiot politicians and muslim countriesnasralla leader of hezbollah in lebanon already told its million syrian refugees to go to europe
no kidding half are muslims in berlin
what do you expect half of berlin is muslim
maybe but muslim brotherhood is much worse dictatorship it would look like iran this is not how they want to look like
if they let muslim brotherhood it will be
muslim brotherhood is a not democratic anyway so if they are in control of the country the lack of democracy would be their last problem
i really like how comments dont feel like saying anything bad about what she said and all they have is but zionistseven if you dont like how israel treats palestinians two wrongs dont make rightunless youre nothing but antisemite
today the two are united but tel aviv was built as separate entity next to jaffa many cities in israel are right next to the other
stolen = allah gave it to us so its ours cause once always really i saw a video weill get back palestine well get back americau can claim arabs were in the area for years when it comes to the but u cant say this about america u r  not native american
how about hamas does what it was told and then well talk about israel needs to do cause israel already did what it was told in the first time and lets be real also the second
un we should always support the oppressors only in the case of the enteral victims the palestinians we should not admit to the rulecan someone tell them their governments oppress them much more than israel
no everyone in these world are saints but israeliran is finenorth korea is finechina is finerussia is finedont believe the gazans believe hamas why not
indeed you cannot like them for being soliders or just israelis but really people have some comments disgraceful
some of them are muslims and they know exactly how in gaza theyll be fineas for the rest
every religion has its extremists including even budahists hindus and christians but most jews are not taught thatbut with the palestinians its almost everywhere and they started to hate us first the jews hate is a result of that
israel who isnt best buddies with iran offered them help ater an earthquake why because israel helps many countries in this situation even not its best friends it knows the iranians arent at fault when it comes to their regime so with an ally isnt it obvious
hamas will release the hostages and then well think about rafah you cant move with this before they finished they part cause israeli did even before the verdict
not the only one jordanians opened a new restautant named october  egypt have many places called october the day yom kipur war started which they see as victory as they surprised israeli even though they eventually lost
and look at the dolls they all look like terrorists
first of all this shows how much hamas influences the young generationsecond a minor should not be part of an army or anything like this but not in the muslim worldand lastly then they say we kill kids arent they some of the kids are like this
you are responding to an indian citizen who hates muslims
is it acceptable to get donations from zionists

err peter obi has never called himself the messiah i dont know where you people got that from
obidients didnt start the messiah talk pdapc started it and they decided to humor you
i didnt ask you for thisyou insinuated that some obidients are painting peter obi as the messiah and im asking for your proof
where is the islamaphobia & racismits factually correct
call me cynical but one assumes they arent part of the pro palestine mobbeing slightly unkind one could be forgiven for thinking they wouldnt have the balls to do that to one of thema certain right wing journalist on the other hand
so youd be ok with the uk supplying palestine with such weapons but not israelwhy is that
a genuine questionwhy do you not concern yourselves on where hamas palestine gets its weapons fromtheirs come from iran china russia north korea and bulgariamaybe if you also took issue with that with the same vigour as well then youd have a bit more credibility
lie mohammed
please need to spell it out just let them do whatever is lawful to defend themselves from terror
let ukraine defend itself anything less is inhumane
world affairs news irans supreme leader said that if we find single evidence that israel is involved in helicopter crash of president of iran  we will response beyond imagination of israel and its allies 
imam ali as every supplication remains veiled until blessings are invoked on the prophet and his progenybihar al anwar vol  pg
imam sadiq as verily being ill natured spoils ones deeds just as vinegar spoils honeyal kafi vol  pg
at this point hamas is just a psyop to convince stupid brainwashed retards that they are not mass murdering brown people using your tax dollars for the purpose of stealing their land
so many good hearted israeli jews wanted to save us all with poison injections right before they waged genocide on palestinians they are such good people we are so lucky they care so much about us
youre an anti semite no you have just been brainwashed to ignore the evil that is jewish supremacy they even have a derogitory name for non jews you are a goyim to them
israel = hamas
youre dead youre dead friend the past in afghanistan died in service to the antichrist so a bunch of jews in the cia could go and smuggle heroin and poison my fellow americanslosers
read on sabbatti tzevi his cult an the function of the boule and the illuminati movements you are all under the control of the antichrist fyi
they do serve the sabbatian antichrists will
there were camps though but the jews that werent converting were the ones they punished and purged  converting to sabbatti tzevis cult i mean
ever consider that  na zi seems more like a short hand for national zionists than socialists there is also supposedly a hidden meaning to it too like idiot or fool in yiddiish or hebrew seems hitler was a sabbatian and supported by them and the jesuits he went native
well the secret is the role of the sabbatians and the jesuits in the holocausts armenian genocide and soviets the camps in germany were to hurt those that wouldnt convert and go to palestine history is insane research basil zarahoff too
the jews are right youre idiots
israel military idf in the process of getting humanitarian aid into gaza this amand hhamas responds with major rocket launch at israel

nooooo how can we expose & publicly humiliate racists misogynists pedos & zionists now
nikki healy is a pedophile she said shes gonna kill innocent palestinian children and send all american money to israel because they own her and then she made up all these stories about palestinian children raping and murdering and torturing is really children
jews love trump but fear trumps top supporters getting organized and violent like tim mcveigh against corruption treason and pedophilia trump promises to let jews run the country who love the clintons obama and bidens we are one family under satan

red sea is owned by yemen and theres nothing anyones gonna do about it

thank you for confirming exactly what you mean by zionists
where peace means submission to islam
i see it every single day i use public transport and im increasingly surrounded by muslims and now africans who dont even bother to speak our language and when they try to with the bus drivers they can barely be understood
and thats the ones willing to give a straight answer to a stranger interviewing thembare in mind that islam directs muslims to deceive kuffar in order to further the expansion of their religion
quran 459 o you who believe obey allah and obey the messenger and those in authority *fromamongyou*quran 1826 allah maketh none to share in his governmentyour loyalty is to allah and your ummah   you assume we kuffar are all ignorant of taqiyya
nazism and fascism are separate though racial supremacy and anti semitism for the former a pseudo religion worship of the almighty state for the latter islam is closer to nazism but is more anti jew than pro one race   its *muslim supremacist*
such statements about jews would be punished *for being lies which result in unjustified mistreatment* and isnt it funny which group your little marxist mind went straight to blaming yet again

genocide apologists not welcome at last we now do have video evidence of beheaded babies from last nights atrocities in rafahjust accept we dont want to hear from youwe despise you and your ilk and the stain on the name of israel will take centuries to fade if ever
i was watching a podcast with a neturei carta rabbi yesterdayhe explained in detail how the whole establishment of israel the red heifer the third temple and trying to force the messiah is the prophecy turned upside down and is in judaic orthodoxy a rebellion against god
israel doesnt want peace it wants everything from the nile to the euphratesill tag you on a video on another account
bombing refugees in rafah last night and blowing the heads off babies willalan i try to be polite but i have to sayyou are a disgusting genocide apologist bastardand to think my grandfather fought in europe to liberate your people   hes turning in his fkng grave
nope that is absolutely not true which is why israel will not permit international forensic teams in to investigateevery person in these cars were incinerated by iof gunship fire at novatook weeks to identify who was hamas who was hostagesame at beeri see yasmin porat
israel is killing civilians deliberatelyplenty of footage of elderly children hit by sniper fire plenty of footage of attempts to bulldoze bodies into the ground in al shifa videos of idf breaking young boys arms with rocksthanks to technology you cant whitewash it anymore

and the irish tricolour symbolises direct confrontation against forces of colonisation and genocide first flown in during the imposed famineit is the diametrical opposite of what the israeli flag stands forto fly it at your pro genocide march is to insult it
we dont make false accusationsi have yet to see a single false accusation against israel in the last years literally not one from any sourcebut i have seen hundreds of false allegations from israel especially beginning oct 
im convinced now of the reality of satan and that satan is driving this diabolical and murderous insanitythats what israel has done for me since oct  fully convinced me that satan is the real not metaphorical prince of this world and that he has emerged
too late israel has dug itself all the way down to hell no comeback im afraid
or better yet let a plenipotentiary fact finding international teams in to establish the actual factsparticularly surrounding nova and beeriof course israel cant allow that but the truth was dripping out now its pouring out and the dam is about to break
and gideon was spot on a truly great jew a truly great manmet him in dublin around i think the first time i knew i was wrong in supporting zionism
approx killed since + of those killed were palestinianidf official numbers
this is truly horrifying veterans from talk and laugh about their murders and rapes in palestine during their invasion of the palestinian people advisory absolutely horrifying stuff
its all coming out nowoh israel you have been stripped naked before the world and you stand before us in shame
effectively they are trying to force against divine willnaturei carta describe the zionist project as a full on rebellion against god and im beginning to think they are right
this whole zionist project is the judaic equivalent of an upside down crucifixthey are trying to fulfil prophecy in reverseprophecy messiah recreation of israel red heifer 3rd templereality rec of israel red heifer 3rd temple messiah
i have actually heard *about* this before i always assumed it was an exaggeration or a fringe theorythis is what netanyahu thought he was destined to make happen he truly has a warped messiah complexthat whole red heifer thing on good friday at the mt of olives holy fuck
hamas would agree to this planisrael and the us would not
apparently this is zionist self defencebombing hospitals is not self defenceimposed starvation is not self defencesuspending water supply is not self defence2000lb bombs on trapped civilians is not self defencetargeting infants and elderly with snipers is not self defence
and the islamic world gave sanctuary to the jews during those centuriesever heard of the pact of umaid in your jurisprudence studies ya clowntoday jews demand that palestinians compensate them for the crimes suffered by their ancestors in christian europe
its pretty much washington only these days even american jews are getting arrested at pro palestine demos
dear alan you are in that great big river in egyptpretty much the entire world is repulsed by the zionist entity and zionists like youjust read the comments on your posts they are quite revealing and you should take em to heart
maybe i will maybe i wont but guess what jenny jenn i wont be basing my decisions on anything you a zionist saylike the majority of the world i just dont do zionism if ya no wat ah meen
and both israelis and palestinians are descended from these peoplesjeez jenn this is open source stuff which clearly you are not aware ofgod must i explain everything to everybody
it would give me great pleasure to join the hamas political party and even its army the qassam brigadeshowever it is not my place to join them in their battle for liberation my role lies elsewhere
i was in jenin about years ago will be in gaza in augustwhy do you ask
no judaism is not an ethnicity it is a religious practice and if you dont observe the torah and its commandments you are not jewishthough not a proselytising religion one can converthad a drink or slept with somebody youre not married to recently observe shabbos
id rather have my entire street filled with hamas neighbours than with zionists i dont tolerate zionists with the same contempt as paedophiles
more likely palestinians are the descendants of those who managed to avoid eviction by the romans post bar kokhbathere is quite an interesting article in haaretz about it from some years back
israel is an artificial and legally baseless entity it has no validity to claim statehood in international law and it is now before the icj icc for abhorrent crimes than will stain it in indelible shame for centuries to comejust as germans today are still ashamed
actually the average askenazim have about  bar cohen hebrew haplotype indicating admixture in europemizrahim have about palestinians as a group are above aint that a doozy palestinians are far more closely related to the hebrews than ashkenazim
as beautiful as raping a child or blowing a yr old to bits in a safe zoneisrael go to the safe zonealso israel ah no we lied as usual heres a lb bomb evil laugh
who are the israeli peoplenetanyahu is polish more than have his cabinet are name changing europeans
israel has stated its intention is not peace but the destruction of the palestinian peopleeven the zionist sympathisers in the icc have been forced to actregretably the icc cannot impose the death penalty for there are many in israel who deserve it
damn right it wouldmy ancestors were put through the same wringer for centuries as the palestinians are being put through now and i will be on the next freedom flotilla so help me godvictory to the resistance and may the genocidal cowards of zionism face their damnation soon
israel hasnt even been able to dent the qassam brigades ffs despite its diabolical slaughter of innocents why do you think there is practically no footage of foot patrols in gaza city khan younis zeitoun etc the uberwarriors of the idf are too afraid to get out of their apcs
no sle its intl lawand israel has committed national suicide by genocideclose to a million israelis have left isr permanently and the surrounding states are now a match for it militarilyregardless of dimona egypt hezbollah iran and others could level israel on their own
houthis have caused economic crisis in israel with a few rockets let israel divest itself from the global system and watch it sink like a stoneno goods or services in or out no permission for its citizens to fly in or out a large gaza if you will lets play that game
so let israel declare itself outlaw the rest of the world will then be legally bound to act in responsewithout the rest of the world israel cannot survive so let it come out and say we reject all humanitarian and intl law and let it deal with the consequences
weak sle youre arguments are weakwe are talking about moral and legal code israel is always going on that it has the right to defend itselfit does not have that right as it does not have a legal foundation to be constituted as a state
also if you knew anything about judaism you would know that the exile is divine decree and will not end till after the massiach has cometo force the end of the exile before that is a rebellion against god and therefore anti judaic
the state of palestine was supposed to be established based on the demographics at midnight  9 1923 which were74 palestinian11 jewish95 xtianit was supposed to be a unitary inclusive state not divided by religious linesthis is fkng basic stuff sleyerra bluffer
your deflection to san remo is also one of the weakest examples of strawman argument ive seen in a while zionists just arent good at this sort of thing
irrelevant league of nations cov art declared a state to be established in mandatory palestine based on the demographics at midnight  9 1923that order or mandate is **jus cogens** and the british failed to discharge their duty

zionists invaded occupied and ethnically cleansed the palestinian people you forgot that one105000 people killed since the invasion99000+ were palestiniansyou forgot that one toowere you born stupid or did you have to take a class
approx killed since the zionists invaded the palestinian people  5 194899000+ of those killed were palestiniansdont you fkng try playing israels victim card around meyou hypocrite
considering practically every other country in the world recognises palestine except aukus and france germany for obvs reasons and italy i think your thesis lacks all credibilityno true irishman cd be a friend of israelin fact it disqualifies you morally from being irish
not good enoughzionists have been exposed uncountable times in a veritable avalanche of lies since oct7apologies in advance if your claims are  bona fide but claims by anyone sporting an israeli flag must be viewed with deep scepticism unless supported by tangible evidence

israel has targeted homes near gazas al shifa hospital killing over palestinians media office in the enclave says condemning international silence over the attacks as israels brutal war enters into its th day
around palestinian worshipers have performed the third friday prayer of the holy month of ramadan at al aqsa mosque in the occupied city of jerusalem despite israeli restrictions an official said
only japan get bomb ha ha
you are enemy manchu destroy you
good to know but if you think jews who support israel are not be threatened and intimidated by protestors you are deeply delusional my friend and that conduct is not protected speechfacts fucking matter
dude thanks for standing up for israel but everyone needs to hear this message
therefore burn their churches and mosques destroy their universities and homes kill the seed of evil before they take root and grow up to hate israel and all jews this is what youre dog whistling for when you cherry pick videos like this
fuck you dude i didnt ask for them to fight on my behalf and if ultra orthodox jews get beat by the idf for merely voicing dissent against gaza how free is your state really sounds like its an illusionmy friend
the only thing that hates you is your hairline bro for keeping it on life support this long guile hair from street fighter dawg how is this the last stand of your follicles this is their death march i know you zionists love killing but theres other ways to express that
i mean this is what you do it for for the opportunity to be able to say thisto be able rub shoulders with vips id rather rub shoulders with a palestinian child than them but youve made your lot in this life i guess hope the price tag isnt too big
nah you lost me here chief i love judaism and jewish people i dislike zionists especially christian evangelical zionists who manipulate religion to justify an illegal occupation and ethnic cleansing campaign thats over years ago youre just prejudiced
can you expand on why you think the beatles are auditory ebola or are you just going to drop a sensational statement w o explanation just like you do with palestine
a scared little boy who deserved to feel safe but was taken from him he blames palestine to avoid having to look in the mirror i hope one day dr saad you give that little boy the love it deserved and you dont die with regret and a guilty conscience
which is why he sneaks in his bigotry using a trojan horse made of pseudointellecual propagandistic talk points that zionists use to justify israels existence its easy this way and gad & his colleagues can keep tenure and their reputation in tact
yeah but the devil can take many forms not just one with horns it can take the form of a year old lebanese marketing professor whose childhood trauma of fleeing the lebanese civil war has manifested in blaming palestinians for the conflict and is still doing the same today
its not much different from the ottomans making the armenians walk in circles so theyd die sooner with the promise of arriving at a refuge camp theyll make palestines move around until theyre dead
the fact you think that israel is a democracy or even the usajoke
sayema ji pls be cautious youre overriding the views of mullahs islam which strongly believes that the koran is supreme
 all the sins murdersrapes & beheading commited on the soils of middle east in the last years had been washed away by benign presiding deity of the hindutemple start a new order
 what is communismwhere is islamic vote bank you throw away your red cloak and build a green cloak it is communism
allah could have been angry at the way namazis were behaving
itll not be surprising if the wakf board claims the women at ones homes besides their assets women are categorised as chattel  fields in islam beware
another victim of attempted love jihad they are starving for hoors but picks up innocent girls to satiate their eternal appetite and dispose them
a violent clash erupted between pro israel and pro palestine supporters at the university of california los angeles with scenes of chaos as over pro israel armed rioters attacked protesting students and professors at the university
saudi arabia hit by freak hailstorm
slap the shit out of them and send them to iran
celebrate diplomacy with our egyptian israeli peace treaty toned proof medal a symbol of hope and unity com produc
i suppprt what youre saying moses
the question of which religion islam
do those who identify as jews serve on the front lines 
children are burned alive in rafah while the party peaksbad karmavery bad
lets assume they wipe out thousands more and take all the landtheyll never live in peace there and jews wont want to come theretheyll have to create a new homeland and settle for a disneyland type holy land ask yourself whose dying in ukr  whose left standing
our god is a vindictive god and so its how we fighte samuelsyou gentileshe was describing how gentiles glorify a right way to fight when in the eyes of the jew this is ridiculous
no im not ok with that how did you get to that idea if im against setting european cities on fire then im a supporter of israel
yes for now ma na money be the problem if we get am we will shock god in sha allah
using the claim of rape to claim someone is anti semitic is absolutely absurd rape knows no ethnicity ethnoreligious group or nationality rape noun is rape regardless of who does the sexual act of forcing oneself on someone that has not agreed to it
against israel isnt anti semitism it is anti zionism or anti israel do you even know what the definition of semitism is it stems from the biblical shem you call yourself an educator but you dont know this shem is a non historical eponymous ancestor
college students should be protesting for an update to the correct definition and usage of the words anti semitism anti semitic and anti semite
american rabbis teachings through the internet need to be held accountable for their extremist ideologies of claims for the united states destruction which is a nationality security threat
these jewish teachers are actually considered extremists and a national security threat by calling for the united states destruction
ashkenaz for sure the semitic word ashkenaz were actually referred to the scythians the scythians carried haplogroup r1a the same with the cimmerians which were called gomer by semitic speakers this means that netanyahu is a male descendant of the non historical japheth
the israelites were polytheistic they believed in the canaanite pantheon where el was the head of the pantheon with asherah as his wife el did not have a child named jesus so you christian are in the wrong you dont know that the israelites originated from the canaanites
why would you bring the holocaust in this situation how weird buddy i dont believe jews are chosen special or superior to anybody you put jews on a pedestal that is your choice freemason george washington has primary sources to prove his existence jesus was no god
keep chasing after mythical jewish deities
linguistically and genetically there is no difference the jews were the continuity of the nd millennium bce canaanite population which the hebrew language originated from the canaanite language
historical jesus wasnt black and he wasnt a god get over it with that false jewish messiah idol
purely goofy neither represent the average palestinian jew in classical antiquity
i already told you the bible isnt historically accurate the samaritans are still in the land they never left there are four families but according to the jews they were all kicked out of the land by the assyrians the bible is not historical accurate
i dont follow jewish men around why would i follow a dead jewish man around
the bible is prophetically clueless it had no idea that america and australia even existed
you are delusional it was regarding the essenes experience with the romans there time ended no jewish messiah saved the jews against the romans
its fantastically mythical no jew was ever born a god sacrificed as a god or arisen as a god it is a jewish fable
that doesnt mean that the bible is historically accurate they picked and chose what went into it no jew ever walked on top of water no jew ever feed people with loaves of bread and fish that is jewish fables
revelation 23 & revelation 13 16 now run along with your false idol jewish messiah
incorrect the bible isnt historically accurate also which unknown jewish authors wrote what how many of these unknown authors were there nothing primary about that
the truth is yahweh didnt write anything and those were jewish authors that wrote all of this no mythical deity wrote or said any of it
there is no telling until other studies have confirmed the populations associated with the different branches of aa such as the akkadians st dynasty egyptians or even meroitic population non aa which isnt associated with cushitic omotic aa speaking populations etc

ol pra todos pra quem me conhece eu sou o luiz e pra quem no me conhece eu sou o luiz tambme sim essa mais uma pgina sobre pocket monsterse nessa pequena thread que eu vou deixar fixado pretendo explicar como ela vai funcionar
j o sanji um azul s que mais prximo do roxo ou seja um anil e o anil a cor do arco ris e o nmero da dex do blaziken
e agora vem a parte que eu quebrei a cabea pra encaixar primeiramente o zoro um espadachim que se especializou no estilo santoryu que o estilo espadas ai conseguimos o nmero referenciando o nmero da pokedex de hoenn do sceptile
zoro foi o membro a entrar no bandonovamente grovyle enquanto sanji foi o  que o nmero do combuskene zoro foi o primeiro a chegar no arquipelago de sabaody que o nmero do treecko e o sanji foi o  infelizmente nesse caso no tem nada
o que isso tem a verbom o nmero da dex de grovyle em hoenn  e do torchic
por exemplo atualmente zoro o membro do bando com a maior recompensa e o sanji o
e pra completar eu gostaria de fazer uma analogia a rivalidade de zoro e sanji que vai dar spoiler de uma postagem futuraambos so bastante competitivos entre si muitas das vezes o zoro cria disputas do nada e o sanji vai na onda
porm em ambos os casos as posies se tornariam menores caso colocssemos aqueles pokmon com uma mesma base stat numa mesma posiomas no existe a necessidade de fazer issono o foco aqui e da mesma formafica visvel o ponto de que um dos pokmon com maior atk do jogo
j o mega blaziken um dos pokmon com maior stat base em ataque do jogo eu abri o pokmon showdown em national dex para fazer uma comparao e atualmente ele est no rank de pokmon com maior ataque com mseros de ataque base enquanto sua forma base fica em
heavy point de tratar os ferimentos de usopp bem como mais tarde ser capaz de pegar e com a ajuda de zoro e jogar franky um cyborg grande e pesado muito alto
uma enorme marreta que parecia pesar vrias toneladas e us la para testar o dial se o dial no tivesse absorvido o impacto sanji provavelmente quebraria um buraco no convs de merry depois que luffy e usopp duelaram em water  sanji foi capaz de impedir chopper em
natural e fora que um homem peixe recebe quando submerso em little garden ele puxou um tyrannosaurus rex morto pela floresta e voltou para o going merry com pouco esforo em skypeia quando gan fall estava explicando os dials sanji mostrou ser capaz de levantar uma enorme
sanji tem imensa fora fsica em sua primeira apario ele segurou fullbody pelo pescoo sem uma mo antes mesmo de mostrar sua fora nas pernas no arco arlong park ele foi capaz de impedir kuroobi de matar genzo e nojiko na gua agarrando sua perna apesar da vantagem
a habilidade oculta de blaziken e do mega blaziken speed boost que uma habilidade que aumenta a velocidade do pokmon em um estgio ao final de cada turno
contra o queen ele se movia to rpido que queen achou que ele estava invisvel
a velocidade a agilidade e os reflexos de sanji so tremendos de fato sua velocidade rivaliza com a de brook e at com luffy no gear second em sua primeira luta contra os piratas krieg sanji se moveu to rpido que parecia que estava desaparecendo e reaparecendo na sua luta
alm de claro todas as tcnicas de fogo que sanji evoluiu durante seu treino no time skip podem ser referenciadas por outros golpes como hell memories que lembra muito o overheat ifrit jamble que pode ser o flare blitz e etc
alm disso a pose da mega evoluo na sua artwork muito parecido com a pose da tcnica do sanji
e sabem qual o signature move do blaziken isso mesmo blaze kickmove do tipo fogo com de power e  de preciso
no arco enies lobby sanji revelou uma nova habilidade   diable jambe   o poder de aquecer as pernas a uma temperatura to alta que elas brilham como fogo vivo girando rapidamente no lugar o que faz com que seu ataque seja mais poderoso
sobre os prdios
e temos mais uma entrada na dex de blaziken que se assemelha a isso alm de referenciar novamente a imensa fora de suas pernaspokedex pokmon fire red leaf greenao enfrentar um inimigo difcil ele solta chamas de seus pulsos suas pernas poderosas permitem que ele salte
perodo de tempo assemelha se efetivamente ao vo os membros do cp9 podem usar esta tcnica para cruzar grandes distncias sem nunca tocar o solo ou se preparar para usar ataques areos rpidos
vale lembrar que aps seu treino sanji consegue usar a tcnica sky walk uma tcnica inspirada no geppo que ele viu sendo usado pela cp9geppo permite que os usurios se levantem do ar com chutes super humanos permitindo que eles viajem e permaneam no ar por um longo
porm as pokedex de blaziken referenciam muito o uso de suas pernas pro combatepokedex pokmon emerald ele aprende artes marciais que usam socos e chutes a cada vrios anos suas penas velhas queimam e novas penas flexveis crescem de volta em seu lugar
muay thai uma arte marcial milenar originria da tailndia o esporte conhecido como arte das oito armas pois combina golpes utilizando os punhos braos cotovelos joelhos e ps
blaziken como a maioria dos pokmon lutador baseado em estilos de luta porm diferentemente do sanji ele baseado em lutador de muay thai bastante visvel at mesmo na sua artwork oficial no o mesmo estilo usado por sanji nesse quesito o hitmontop seria mais prximo
e ele prefere no usar suas mos j que elas so feitas apenas para cozinhar
seu estilo uma combinao nica do estilo brasileiro capoeira do francs savate e do coreano taekwondo capaz de usar poderosos chutes com versatilidade suprema
devido a anos de treinamento extremamente duros com zeff desde a infncia sanji ganhou extraordinrias habilidades fsicas velocidade e agilidade sobre humanas o que o permite usar uma arte marcial baseada em chutes o que o torna imensamente verstil em combate
abaixo da realeza eventualmente com oito anos sanji cortou todos os laos com sua famlia e cruzou a red line em direo ao east blue
por seus irmos por servir comida aos que consideravam ser ratos seu pai vinsmoke judge no mostrou nenhuma preocupao com ele dizendo lhe que ele era intil e uma vergonha para a famlia porque ele escolheu se envolver em atividades que judge considerava
sanji nasceu no north blue na famlia vinsmoke a famlia real do reino germa enquanto ele e seus trs irmos nasceram no mesmo dia sanji nasceu em terceiro lugar tornando o terceiro prncipe do reino durante sua infncia que ele passou no reino germa sanji foi maltratado

e o hitmonlee capaz de usar o move sleep talk essapermite que enquanto o pokemon estiver dormindo ele consiga usar um dos seus outros movimentos que ele conhece de forma completamente aleatria
toma um dano como consequncia ele tambm aprende jump kick que mais fraco mas tem o mesmo efeito alm de close combat e superpoweresses no ganham aumento pela habilidadeque vo dropando os status a medida que so usadosou sejaos seus golpes mais fortes oferecem riscos
uma das habilidades do pokmon reckless imprudncia o pokmon com essa habilidade far um dano vezes maior ao usar ataques recoilque ajuda a aumentar o poder de um dos golpes mais perigosos que o high jump kickque tem de base powermas se o usurio erra ele
lee pode agora abrir os portes de chakra instantaneamente at mesmo mostrando uma taxa de recuperao mais rpida ao us los sem sofrer qualquer um dos efeitos prejudiciais posteriores mas ele ainda mostra uma exausto perceptvel
lee tambm aprendeu ou desenvolveu uma srie de taijutsu que aproveitam o poder extremo e velocidade que ele ganha ao abrir os portes de chakra aps o intervalo de tempo
muito mais do que isso ao se aproximar dos  os msculos comeam a quebrar e se desintegram uma vez que o oitavo porto aberto o usurio tornasse praticamente imparvel mas morre no processo
os msculos para gerarem muito mais poder do que normalmente fazem permitindo que o usurio atinja velocidades fenomenais levantar enormes pesos e muito mais custa dos prprios msculos perto de  os msculos comeam a se desgastar e rasgar
lee s permitido abri los em certas circunstncias tais como situaes de vida ou morte proteger algum querido ou defender seu modo ninja a maioria dos seres humanos s pode acessar menos de  do seu potencial muscular mas os oito portes usa chakra para forar
atravs dos ensinamentos de guy lee aprendeu a abrir os cinco primeiros portes de chakra aos anos e mais tarde o sexto porto em algum momento antes da quarta guerra mundial shinobi por causa do perigo que seu corpo corre ao utilizar o poder dos portes
o hitmonlee shiny possu uma colorao verde e em seus membros ele possu espcies de molas que lembram muito as ataduras e polainas do lee

su diseo su aplomo en carretera su seguridad eficiencia tecnologa y acabados premium
en carolina del sur  usa  tambin estarn trabajando en breve china es el mayor mercado automovilstico del mundo otras grandes marcas tambin tienen all sus fbricas tesla por ejemplo
tu cerebro s que es basura
venga ya que tienes la frmula construye uno por ese precio con un combustible ruinoso de h ineficiente inestable y peligroso y nos echamos unas risas
que usted no tenga buen gusto no es culpa de polestar es su falta de conocimiento de historia del arte y de una carencia de criterio esttico abrumadora
las batera no se deja a  que lo sepas
viven en el pleistoceno inferior en este tema no tendrn mi voto
una nefasta inversin para nio el polestar se recarga en  por ejemplo y esto es solo el principio t sabrs que tanto sabes
a no en pleno verano lo normal al sol es que en el interior se alcancen temperaturas de hasta ms de 
se vender
no lo veo viable en aos estos intercambiadores quedarn obsoletos ante las bateras de estado slido u otra tecnologa disruptiva que lleve menos tiempo de carga que estos intercambiadores mi batera es ma y no la voy cambiando por otra que no s qu problemas puede dar

combatir los bevs con ms bevs es lo mejor que nos puede pasar a todos en un mundo que agoniza
alczar segovia  spain 
se llama terror a la inquiocupacin sigan votando como siempre
con una tendencia en espaa a vender bevs demasiado bien les va
qu maravilla
un icono para los que disfrutamos los  ser muy interesante ver el mismo cules son sus puntos fuertes y sus posibles mejoras a m el coche de momento me gusta por su diseo si impulsa la movilidad electrificada y saca a espaa de su  de ventas ve
tal y como est de retrasada espaa en ves cualquier nuevo electrificado sea bienvenido estos tendrn su pblico seguro y tras ayudas quedar un precio bastante competitivo
toyota haba mucho y hace poco es la empresa ms alejada de la movilidad ecolgica conocida siempre con promesas incumplidas y realidades empresariales del sxx
es un coche bueno un cochazo repetir consignas absurdas de los que tienen intereses econmicos brutales en el negocio del sucio petrleo es lo que tiene espero que sea tu caso si no es de locos
una de las cuestiones es preguntarse quin se chupa km en un solo da y en su caso no puede perder minutos de su precioso tiempo mientras come o simplemente descansa o va al aseo o estira las piernas
la ignorancia siempre fue muy atrevida
el mercado debe regularse solo voy a empezar a regular yo tambin el mercado y hacer lo imposible para no consumir nada que tenga su origen en japn
defender una tecnologa tan contaminante como la obsoleta combustin es a estas alturas cosa de locos literalmente
los ice tambin suben de precio con el tiempo qu curioso
el h es el timo del tocomocho inestable ineficiente y extremadamente caro a ver qu nueva tecnologa acaba con la luz pues eso tonteras
si entiendes que europa es espaa e italia s el futuro inminente es  elctrico apostar por tecnologas obsoletas es un craso error lo veremos
especialmente dentro de aos hay que rerse
ay la envidia cmo abunda en este pas de miseria
el lujo no es para todo el mundo el precio es mucho ms que razonable para sus homlogos el restoenvidia absurda y tal
la tecnologa siempre va mejorando cualquier excusa vale para vivir anclado en el medievo
precio muy ajustado para todo lo que ofrece
el color dorado es espectacular
este es el  otra pasada
lleva tropecientos aos perdiendo dinero ya veremos cmo acaba
ya le gustara a tesla polestar est a aos luz de esos cacharros

las posadas is usually a multiday celebration mexico has been celebrating it for years i will be honest the more religious parts i am not verh familiar with im mexican america but what is happening in the image here is the piatas breaking before a big feast
about la posadas the most direct translation of the sign is the sublime and glorious posada of arataki idk what ran is in spanish help me ada means inn & this celebration uses the word to refer to the inn in the nativity story

also each group is done from different firing positions first is standing kneeling is second sitting is rd then last is prone the idea is to focus on aerobic stress to bring your heart rate up which makes breath control more critical and important for shooter accuracy
said it before this type of stress training is terrible and only increases risk a better stress training would be to run a k do a shot group do pushups another shot group sit ups shot group and then chin ups before the last shot group
these stress drills are nothing more than escalation of risk if youre getting barrels thrown at you and water splashed on you maybe you should move where you arent being splashed and getting barrels thrown at you

now that the manager issue has been sorted out i hope the board will be logical in their next move in the transfer market by going for what the team needs most especially the right man to replace thiago silva and a point man to complement jackson and were set for next season
welcome to the best team in europe enzo maresca lets the success journey begins
while chelsea is sorting out the issue of manager an elite defender tosin adarabioyo is being discussed as well epl teams its about to be scary for you coz we are just getting started
my boy is back if any of our midfielder is going theres no need to send him out again hes matured and grown up with ball
fact lets say the first five game will give is a glimpse of what he can offer
pre season will soon commence well be aware who were dealing with by then
some kind questions will just drive you crazy this set of players are phenomenal choosing based on sentiment fabregas ozil kross and pogba in that order
that leg must have trained with messi before palmer himself started playing
head up man the best is yet to come go show them what you got and represent chelsea well at the euro
no pressure man either legend or trophy lift na lift
stop it man arsenal is watching
no one plays for the badge more than this guy last season proper chelsea
sarri ball still stick in my head but i feel there are more creative players in the squad now that can execute and triumph with his tactics
were not instigating any agenda to sign players from leicester we need to wrap up the enzo deal and face the next target no distraction pls
land don finish for lag na why no vex
so excited right now at least the team will have an injury free defender whose skill and experience will impact our productivity
if arsenal has a touch of blue in their jersey they wont be suffering for titles like this coz blue colour particularly chelsea species represents success
its especially bad in rpgs right now dnd has metastasized completely into a baudrilliardian simulacra you used to play dnd to pretend to be aragorn now you play to be a fighter class but with a twist nobody role plays anymore
i was man u supporter with my pals in junior school by high school i was arsenal like the rest of my family and my nd team is villa because of williamof course i support england but also wales because of william my international team is real madrid because of ronaldo
i hope iain duncan smith is next

you could do that at westray and papa westray i am sure in half the time
did ryanair serve that
i did agree with you with tof being a different game and it is not completely fair to compare it to a game of other genre but still tof is still close enough to games such as genshin and wuthering waves because of their similarities open world gacha elements etc

theyre trying really hard for it to beat mhw sales
this game is half fan service and i love itgive us moar and give us dendra
wouldve been a great game without the stupid building
not gonna lie i wanted a great wulg in game
except that kirins head was garbage to manyhating on mhw is the popular bandwagon nowadays every mh has something that might suck but theyre still awesome games because theyre mh thats right wyvern riding might be trash but rise is still a great game
people actually like that for some reason but i think its stupid lets look at rajangits so slow with its delays that its not even a threat anymore mhfu rajang can attack faster and thats laughably idiotic
finally a unique sync animation never make sync impact beam sync moves againsync move animations are half the sync pair
people should just boycott this game and not summon on these generic sync move pairs not only should they stop doing this they should update all generic sync move animations in the game except for egg pokmons and unevolved forms

many gamefi projects dont even have a game but not have already launchedsome stats + active players + daily active players + hours playedand they are launching more games this year bullish onmon
if they did people would be crying about the price of the game or some other like why not ac black flag or modern era ac but hey i dont think any other ac game received this much attention ever so more people cry more free advertisement ubisoft gets
when the bug mission hit the average active player count was k + now its k no chance any major order will be completed unless ah makes optimizations
are there any plans to balance the game especially major orders now that the active player count dropped significantly and the remaining community is struggling to keep up with the scale of the orders
its a pc game and sony brought the ip for a sequel ps players make up less than  3rd of all players i dare sony to go ahead and remove it from pc not only it will kill the game but they will pay times of the revenue from the class action lawsuit
so now that sony withdraw the decisions all players who said its not that deep or it takes only sec can be marked as traitors of democracy and shot on sight
the biggest disappointment at least for me is how much impact joel has in the war if he wants he can reset any and all progress players made upscale and downscale progression as he sees fit and players progress are futile at this point as there seems to be no reward or penalty
so far winning only proved they will hit the reset button immediately so who cares of we win or lose theres no benefit or penalty and all veteran players are already maxed out on medals
you deserved it for still playing that shit overwatch
if you lock missions in a sp game behind season passes its just pure trash its not a hate wagon
yeah sure 70 base game 130 with dlcs and a freaking season pass for a single player game with forced network connection that you loose as soon they stop supporting the game definitely worth a buy
quasar was nerfed literally two days after its release but there was no patch note about it same goes for railgun it was already buffed but they intentionally kept it out of the patch notes
because your explanation for the letdown which is sw outlaws mc design is that its much of a hassle to create smooth models if it was a side character it would be understandable that cost and time investment is more than the benefit but its the mc of a  game
you could have stopped after ubisoft thats good enough reason to avoid the game already
likely not happening maybe in couple years when they finish the game contents but im all for letting bots push for super earth i want to fight in urban area and not different colored barren lands
the kick system is annoying they should make it vote based or disable it and make it available after conditions are met like afk death or team kills
thats bs sbi wasnt involved with starfield star field is bat at its core and it was poorly made especially coming from a dev like bethesda who had multiple cult classic games
make the kick system vote based or restrict the kick to work under one of these conditions the player was afk lets say no input registered for min or committed friendly fire

r9 in knoxville against humans g1 at life with emry aether spellbomb urza goose + th land in hand astrolabe opal in play and untapped land opponent has mantis rider attacking available mana including noble hierarch and cards in hand after curving dork riderx2
i wound up losing to ouphe pretty easily as i got attacked for  5 damage every turn with most of my green sources turned off for the thragtusk whoops
playing tron at regionals and in g3 against elves i mulliganed to keeping a first cards of plant mine sphere oblivion stone and i have my choice of karn liberated thragtusk and relic of progenitus as my th i failed to consider ouphe and chose tusk over karn as payoff
playing some golos gates on mtgo and have the game under relative control at life against naya feather and rather than making an attack that forces my opponent to block with their creature so i can clean it up with gates ablaze i only sent my beanstalk giant and left back
opponent keeping their ponder cant mean theyre missing land drop in retrospect theres more going on there
opponent forces and i daze and i eventually get ahead with a resolved goyf and lose over time to tnn that puts us back at parity and my opponent draws better but i think all of this could have been avoided by either a dazing the delver or b playing fetch on turn despite snare
i keep fetch brainstorm daze and pass my opponent fails to flip and casts arcanist and im put in another bind of dazing on the backfoot vs playing wrenn that turn to answer the delver and have wrenn vs arcanist after a turn cycle i decide to allow it to resolve and cast wrenn
opponent casts delver of secrets and i tank i can daze to ensure it doesnt resolve or i can presumably untap and cast wrenn with daze backup into what i expect to be my opponent missing their land drop or playing a land and a follow up spell they care about more than delver
legacy is a format that leads to a lot of mistakes naturally and today is no different for me g1 playing rug vs ur delver opponent plays island ponder on the play i have trop fetch waste brainstorm daze wrenn snare force of negation after draw step so i play trop and pass
so by giving them a land i think i gave them a much more important piece of their way to win than the graveyard had to be in my own i wound up losing to mirran crusader because my mills were bad and my opponent had the resources to beat my more anemic draw
i wound up choosing the nd line because i thought one of the best ways to punish my opponents mulligan was to try to make a hogaak or vengevines to close the game quickly but in thinking about it im only worried about drops in their deck which they need more lands to cast
 play gravecrawler fetch a tapped land and make the game about a race of my  1s against champion which means any removal spell likely wins the race unless a better creature than crawler comes down2 eot assassins trophy the leyline and cast wayfinder supplier
playing hogaak vs humans post board my opponent had mulliganed to and opened on leyline horizon canopy champion of the parish to my gravecrawler the following turn opponent plays nothing and attacks for  on my turn i have the following options
had a match against martyr as mono red phoenix where the board got very complicated and i lost track of creatures able and unable to attack as well as forgot a few shrine triggers along my complicated sequences hard to process so much coming in but i think my macro was good
otherwise think im playing very sharp today but this round was not my best work
the other was in g3 i chose to force my opponent to cast spells in turn to kill me by recurring my vengevines and casting hogaak rather than fatal pushing and setting up to always be able to make hogaak and attackers in one turn with no chance of guaranteed
made mistakes this round playing hogaak vs izzet phoenix in game i ran out a carrion feeder without a second creature to follow up and a vengevine in yard hogaak in hand and never produced creatures in a turn following real sloppy play just didnt think
this round against elves i underestimated how much of a boardstate my opponent could make from quirion ranger and land so i decided to cantrip towards countermagic my hand was lacking rather than abrading the creature to follow into izzet staticaster which i wanted to clean up
my delver and leave me with no opportunity to trade off my snare or means of finding an answer my opponent cast me and easily defeated me because i misevaluated the impact of arcanist on the board we were in legacy is really tough
round i played against izzet delver and on turn with my opponent having dazed volc island available next turn i bolted their delver and cast preordain seeing bolt delver i top top drawing delver and my hand is snare delver waste fetch with fetch untapped
this left me vulnerable to tnn if my opponent had it which i can basically only fight on the stack in my deck while i didnt get punished my play just left me underdeveloped and without protection for my potential soft lock
round playing against grixis delver as temur delver in legacy i have my opponent very far behind to wrenn wasteland starting next turn and they tap out to cast dreadhorde arcanist after preordain i have abrade daze and chose to cast daze rather than untap cast abrade
this is true playing delver decks and looking at a hand full of lands makes me nervous but i always could have brainstormed later definitely let myself get caught up in worrying about something irrelevant
